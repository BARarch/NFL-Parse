       "'    GREEN BAY – The rookie road was bumpy, filled with pitfalls and detours that rerouted  Joe Callahan  from Green Bay to New Orleans to Cleveland in a span of seven weeks.   The positive was experience. Callahan had the privilege of sharing quarterback rooms with  Aaron Rodgers  and Drew Brees. The drawback was the rapid change in scenery and endless game of musical playbooks.   The spinning finally ended in December when Callahan re-signed to the Packers’ practice squad prior to receiving a promotion to the active roster two weeks later.   When the year was over and Callahan had a chance to look back on his rookie campaign, one thing became abundantly clear to the 6-foot-1, 216-pound quarterback.   “It’s something I don’t want to go through again,” said Callahan on Sunday. “I didn’t like the feeling of being cut and bouncing around. Going into the offseason, I made sure I was in shape and doing everything I could to prepare myself. Once I got back here, I was ready to go.”   For all the upheaval, Callahan’s rookie season was quite astounding considering the 2015 Gagliardi Trophy winner – given to the best Division III player in the country – went from a relatively unheard of draft prospect to cracking the 53-man roster of three teams as a rookie.   The Packers raised many eyebrows when they signed Callahan shortly after the 2016 NFL Draft concluded. While Callahan posted record-breaking numbers at Wesley (Del.) College, there’s no guarantee D-III production will translate.   For Callahan, it did. With Aaron Rodgers playing sparingly in the preseason and  Brett Hundley  dealing with an ankle injury, Callahan completed 54-of-88 passes for 499 yards and three touchdowns in four exhibition games.   He not only beat out former North Carolina quarterback Marquise Williams for the Packers’ third-string job, Callahan also earned a spot on Green Bay’s opening roster.   As impressive as his rise was last summer, Callahan feels light years ahead of where he was a year ago. In the preseason opener against Philadelphia last Thursday, he completed 10-of-16 passes for 103 yards in a little more than a quarter of work.   Known for his mobility and resourcefulness, Callahan made perhaps his best pass on a 34-yard toss to first-year receiver  Max McCaffrey  on an extended play.   “Last year, you’re a rookie just trying to learn a whole new offense and have an idea of your reads,” Callahan said. “This year, I feel I have a solid grasp of the offense and it’s helped speed up my game, speed up my reads and my ability to make good decisions.   “I just feel more comfortable this year. I think that definitely helps in my progression.”   The other factor aiding his development has been working in the Packers’ quarterbacks room, where he has access to Rodgers, Hundley, quarterbacks coach Alex Van Pelt and even Head Coach Mike McCarthy at times.   The room is open-minded. Each day, suggestions are made, opinions are given and everybody has a say in what’s happening on film. While the pointers help, so does the competitiveness.   Callahan got a feel for how intense the competitive fire burns among the quarterbacks during last year’s weekly trivia competitions. It was only recently the final scores were tallied, with the QBs edging the offensive line for bragging rights.   “Oh yeah, it was serious,” Callahan said. “We were definitely competing. Everyone had their role and we’re just happy the quarterbacks got to take home the win and showboat a little bit, rub it in.”   Like last year, Callahan again faces competition for the No. 3 job. This year, it comes in the form of former BYU quarterback  Taysom Hill , who completed 5-of-6 passes for 69 yards and a touchdown in the 24-9 win over the Eagles.   With Rodgers resting, the three backup QBs threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns, completing passes to 14 different receivers.   “There’s a lot of talent in the quarterback room,” receiver  Jeff Janis  said. “Those guys continue to impress us in practice, too. It’s not just in the games. What they can do in practice is something that’s pretty special in their room.”   Competition comes naturally in training camp. Callahan knows it’s every NFL team’s prerogative to bring in guys to compete for jobs every season.   The biggest thing Callahan has working in his favor – other than the ability to create out of the pocket – is his composure. While the jump from Wesley’s 2,500-seat Scott D. Miller Stadium to Lambeau Field might intimidate some, it hasn’t flustered Callahan.   He’s flourished under the spotlight.   “There was definitely a couple moments last year that it dawns on you that you’re in the NFL and you’re working with some of your favorite players you grew up watching,” Callahan said. “A couple moments here or there, but other than that, it’s work and these are my friends.   “It’s not something I think of too often. … I think (my parents) have those moments a little more often.”   '"

       "'LATROBE, Pa. – If the Steelers offensive line were part of the selection committee, Alan Faneca would already be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.     They are fans of his, not just because he wore the black and gold and is helping them during training camp, but because they know the type of player he was.     “A guy like him, he is a Hall of Famer in all of our books,” said  Ramon Foster . “We have heard so much about him, know much about him, what he accomplished. \\xa0Having him here passing on his wisdom and stories, I think it’s cool as ever. I enjoy having him around every year.”   Faneca, a Hall of Fame finalist the last two years, has been working with the Steelers’ offensive line and tight ends as a coaching intern during training camp for the second straight year.     “It’s fun. It’s good to be back,” said Faneca. “Having done it last year, knowing the guys, checking back in on them and seeing how they have progressed, what they are up to, their off the field life, it’s been fun.”     Being back around the game he loves so much is something Faneca has given a lot of thought to. He said he would love to get into coaching if the situation is right, and is taking advantage of this opportunity to continue to learn from offensive line coach Mike Munchak and tight ends coach James Daniel.     “You play football your whole life and then you are away from it,” said Faneca. “To come back and be a part of it again is fun. You retire, leave the game, and everyone asks if you miss playing. The answer generally is no. I miss it during the playoffs and the guys in the locker room, that kind of stuff. That is what most guys would tell you they miss. Here I solve one of those, being back in the atmosphere, enjoying football. It’s something I have come to enjoy and I really could see myself doing it.”    The highlight for him now is being able to share some tricks of the trade and some tips, especially with the younger players who have said his guidance has been helpful.    “You don’t always know if things sink in when you say things,” said Faneca. “You have to tell different guys different things. Different guys are at different stages of their careers. To know some of them retain it and put it to use feels good.     “I always try to find stuff they haven’t been told before, didn’t know and try to put it to use. If you see somebody do something, not a mistake, where the block is harder than it should be, and if they can try something different, to give them that little tidbit to make their life easier, that is a win for me.” \\xa0    And for the Steelers offensive line, a win for them would be seeing Faneca get his due and be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.    “I appreciate their support a ton,” said Faneca. “I have just as much respect hearing it coming from those guys. Those are the guys in the trenches doing the same things I have done. It’s nice to know they have that kind of respect for me, the game and the guys who came before them.” Social Spotlight:         '"

       "'LATROBE Pa  If the Steelers offensive line were part of the selection committee Alan Faneca would already be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame     They are fans of his not just because he wore the black and gold and is helping them during training camp but because they know the type of player he was     A guy like him he is a Hall of Famer in all of our books said  Ramon Foster  We have heard so much about him know much about him what he accomplished Having him here passing on his wisdom and stories I think its cool as ever I enjoy having him around every year   Faneca a Hall of Fame finalist the last two years has been working with the Steelers offensive line and tight ends as a coaching intern during training camp for the second straight year     Its fun Its good to be back said Faneca Having done it last year knowing the guys checking back in on them and seeing how they have progressed what they are up to their off the field life its been fun     Being back around the game he loves so much is something Faneca has given a lot of thought to He said he would love to get into coaching if the situation is right and is taking advantage of this opportunity to continue to learn from offensive line coach Mike Munchak and tight ends coach James Daniel     You play football your whole life and then you are away from it said Faneca To come back and be a part of it again is fun You retire leave the game and everyone asks if you miss playing The answer generally is no I miss it during the playoffs and the guys in the locker room that kind of stuff That is what most guys would tell you they miss Here I solve one of those being back in the atmosphere enjoying football Its something I have come to enjoy and I really could see myself doing it    The highlight for him now is being able to share some tricks of the trade and some tips especially with the younger players who have said his guidance has been helpful    You dont always know if things sink in when you say things said Faneca You have to tell different guys different things Different guys are at different stages of their careers To know some of them retain it and put it to use feels good     I always try to find stuff they havent been told before didnt know and try to put it to use If you see somebody do something not a mistake where the block is harder than it should be and if they can try something different to give them that little tidbit to make their life easier that is a win for me     And for the Steelers offensive line a win for them would be seeing Faneca get his due and be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame    I appreciate their support a ton said Faneca I have just as much respect hearing it coming from those guys Those are the guys in the trenches doing the same things I have done Its nice to know they have that kind of respect for me the game and the guys who came before them Social Spotlight         '"

       "'LATROBE Pa – If the Steelers offensive line were part of the selection committee Alan Faneca would already be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame     They are fans of his not just because he wore the black and gold and is helping them during training camp but because they know the type of player he was     “A guy like him he is a Hall of Famer in all of our books” said  Ramon Foster  “We have heard so much about him know much about him what he accomplished \\xa0Having him here passing on his wisdom and stories I think it’s cool as ever I enjoy having him around every year”   Faneca a Hall of Fame finalist the last two years has been working with the Steelers’ offensive line and tight ends as a coaching intern during training camp for the second straight year     “It’s fun It’s good to be back” said Faneca “Having done it last year knowing the guys checking back in on them and seeing how they have progressed what they are up to their off the field life it’s been fun”     Being back around the game he loves so much is something Faneca has given a lot of thought to He said he would love to get into coaching if the situation is right and is taking advantage of this opportunity to continue to learn from offensive line coach Mike Munchak and tight ends coach James Daniel     “You play football your whole life and then you are away from it” said Faneca “To come back and be a part of it again is fun You retire leave the game and everyone asks if you miss playing The answer generally is no I miss it during the playoffs and the guys in the locker room that kind of stuff That is what most guys would tell you they miss Here I solve one of those being back in the atmosphere enjoying football It’s something I have come to enjoy and I really could see myself doing it”    The highlight for him now is being able to share some tricks of the trade and some tips especially with the younger players who have said his guidance has been helpful    “You don’t always know if things sink in when you say things” said Faneca “You have to tell different guys different things Different guys are at different stages of their careers To know some of them retain it and put it to use feels good     “I always try to find stuff they haven’t been told before didn’t know and try to put it to use If you see somebody do something not a mistake where the block is harder than it should be and if they can try something different to give them that little tidbit to make their life easier that is a win for me” \\xa0    And for the Steelers offensive line a win for them would be seeing Faneca get his due and be enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame    “I appreciate their support a ton” said Faneca “I have just as much respect hearing it coming from those guys Those are the guys in the trenches doing the same things I have done It’s nice to know they have that kind of respect for me the game and the guys who came before them” Social Spotlight         '"
