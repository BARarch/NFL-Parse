If Gillislee can stay healthy he has already shown the ability to get into the end zone, including in goal line drills in practice early in camp, and also take advantage of opportunities that will come to him as a runner in the pass-first attack.

He played the bulk of the game but it wasn’t a great performance. He realized the fears of many Patriots fans when he gave up the edge to Anthony Zettel, who hit Brady’s arm as he threw.

He’s not had a great summer and that continued in Detroit. Richards was used in more of a linebacker or in-the-box role against the Lions, unfortunately his tackling wasn’t exactly what you look for in that spot. His missed tackle keyed Dwayne Washington’s catch-and-run 18-yard touchdown.

In fact, each had key positive plays in the win. Butler punched a ball out of Golden Tate’s hands on Detroit’s first offensive play, helping build the big early lead. Then Gostkowski nailed the game-winning kick, his third made field goal of the night. But each is held to a higher standard. For Butler, that means his 23-yard touchdown allowed to Marvin Jones isn’t good enough, especially after last week’s struggles in coverage against the Texans. Gostkowski missed a PAT in the first quarter, his second missed PAT this summer and third missed kick overall. Both players are still elite players, but they are also held to a higher standard. They can and will be better.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\">\\n    \\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-video field--type-file field--label-hidden\">\\n    <div class=\"media-nflc-video media-nflc-fpp-584471\">\\n  <nflcs:avplayer id=\"avplayer-extended\"\\n        data-config=\"http://www.patriots.com/media/nflc-config.json\"\\n    data-contentId=\"fpp-584471\"\\n    data-autoplay=\"false\"\\n    data-pr=\"3\"    data-offset=\"0\"    data-companion=\"1\"\\n    data-channelkey=\"Video_NFL\"\\n    data-channelid=\"2256\"\\n    data-adtagsuffix=\"\"\\n    data-playername=\"media-player-embed\"\\n    data-chromeless=\"\"\\n    data-mediatype=\"video\"\\n        data-videoID=\"f0cb4900-1e77-4da8-b0b8-1fe6c3dcc8db\"        class=\"nflcs-avplayer\"\\n    ></nflcs:avplayer>\\n</div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n    Stephen Gostkowski kicks game winning field goal  </div>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p><em>What do you think of our lists?

The offense opened the game with <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong> at his surgical best, completing all four of his passes for 59 yards during a 75-yard touchdown drive. The march included a nice mix of <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/dion-lewis\" data-player-height=\"5-8\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Pittsburgh\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0013_lewis_dion.png?itok=bOx9mQCO&timestamp=1497567313\" class=\"player\">Dion Lewis</a></strong> runs with passes to <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/julian-edelman\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Kent State\" data-player-experience=\"9\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0019_edelman_julian.png?itok=XBS_x3I6&timestamp=1497563247\" class=\"player\">Julian Edelman</a></strong> (more on him in a moment) with Brady operating at times with tempo and the no huddle approach. The Patriots had Detroit scrambling and wouldn’t relent. In turn the defense forced a turnover on the Lions first play when <strong>Matthew Stafford’s</strong> pass to <strong>Golden Tate</strong> was knocked loose by <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcolm-butler-0\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"West Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_butler_malcolm.png?itok=qp7y7-vt&timestamp=1497559945\" class=\"player\">Malcolm Butler</a></strong>. Brady then took the quick change and hit <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/chris-hogan\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Monmouth (N.J.)\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-2017-hogan-chris-headshot-revised.png?itok=vlWt8xdt&timestamp=1497563672\" class=\"player\">Chris Hogan</a></strong> for a 32-yard touchdown. The game was less than five minutes old and it was already 13-0. That was a big part of the team’s MO back in 2007 when the offense suffocated the life out of opponents on a regular basis.</p>\\n<p>-Unfortunately it was not all roses for the offense as Edelman went down with a potentially serious right knee injury. Multiple reports indicated the Patriots fear the wideout tore his ACL but that had yet to be confirmed. Edelman caught three passes on the drive before crumbling to the turf after the final one, suffering a non-contact injury that ended his night.</p>\\n<p>-Depending on Edelman’s status, if he’s out long term it would open up a roster spot but not necessarily for a wide receiver. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/devin-lucien\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Arizona State\" data-player-experience=\"1\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0011_lucien_devin.png?itok=0SxtChiw&timestamp=1497566947\" class=\"player\">Devin Lucien</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/austin-carr\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Northwestern\" data-player-experience=\"Rookie\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_carr_austin.png?itok=Mn3Z5AEy&timestamp=1497560289\" class=\"player\">Austin Carr</a></strong> would be candidates if Bill Belichick went that route but <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/dj-foster\" data-player-height=\"6-0\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Arizona State\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0013_foster_d.j.png?itok=zqMfRJYN&timestamp=1497563267\" class=\"player\">D.J. Foster</a></strong> would also factor into that mix. Foster was a wide receiver in college and has shown the ability to catch the ball effectively in the preseason. He did enough to earn a roster spot last season despite being inactive most of the year. There’s also the possibility that Belichick doesn’t use a receiver at all and instead simply looks for the next-best player on the bubble. One factor to keep in mind is the punt return game. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/danny-amendola\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Texas Tech\" data-player-experience=\"9\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/2016_amendola_headshot_0.png?itok=Lk1vOb0E&timestamp=1464729420\" class=\"player\">Danny Amendola</a></strong> could be a more important piece on offense if Edelman is out, and Belichick may not want to expose him to further punishment as the punt returner. Many people believe <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cyrus-jones\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0023_jones_cyrus.png?itok=KUx5hJfu&timestamp=1497567532\" class=\"player\">Cyrus Jones</a></strong> could be on the bubble and perhaps his presence as a returner could make him safe.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\">\\n    \\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-video field--type-file field--label-hidden\">\\n    <div class=\"media-nflc-video media-nflc-fpp-584446\">\\n  <nflcs:avplayer id=\"avplayer-extended\"\\n        data-config=\"http://www.patriots.com/media/nflc-config.json\"\\n    data-contentId=\"fpp-584446\"\\n    data-autoplay=\"false\"\\n    data-pr=\"1\"    data-offset=\"0\"    data-companion=\"1\"\\n    data-channelkey=\"Video_Press_Conference\"\\n    data-channelid=\"2316\"\\n    data-adtagsuffix=\"\"\\n    data-playername=\"media-player-embed\"\\n    data-chromeless=\"\"\\n    data-mediatype=\"video\"\\n        data-videoID=\"11e05fe0-17a7-48eb-99f4-d977ebf582ed\"        class=\"nflcs-avplayer\"\\n    ></nflcs:avplayer>\\n</div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n    Tom Brady 8/25: \\'We\\'re all hoping for the best\\'  </div>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p>-Interestingly, Belichick had both Jones and Amendola back deep together to return the Lions first punt of the night. At times in the past he’s employed two return men but generally has one further upfield and one back deep. Against Detroit both were almost side by side instead.</p>\\n<p>-<strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong> made his preseason debut and Belichick may have offered a glimpse about his potential as a goal line back. He entered the game for the first time with the Patriots already leading 13-0 and the ball sitting at the Lions 1. He easily worked his way off right tackle behind <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/james-develin\" data-player-height=\"6-3\" data-player-weight=\"255\" data-player-position=\"FB\" data-player-college=\"Brown\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0023_develin_james.png?itok=v78L3GFE&timestamp=1497563265\" class=\"player\">James Develin</a></strong> and James O’Shaughnessy with the latter serving as the third tight end. When the Lions were flagged on the PAT, Belichick opted to accept the penalty and attempt a two-point conversion, which Gillislee and the Patriots converted by running the same exact play. Gillislee later added a 27-yard run, showing some big play ability in addition to his nose for the goal line.</p>\\n<p>-Perhaps overshadowed by the tremendous offense early on, the defense was equally dominant. On the Lions first four series the Patriots limited them to 36 yards and no first downs. Butler punched the ball away from Tate to stop the first drive and three punts soon followed. Matt Patricia used a rotation at corner as the first half progressed, starting with <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/eric-rowe\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"205\" data-player-position=\"DB\" data-player-college=\"Utah\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0040_rowe_eric.png?itok=ML3zLcVs&timestamp=1497568195\" class=\"player\">Eric Rowe</a></strong> as the third corner before having him replace first Butler and then <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/stephon-gilmore\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"South Carolina\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0008_gilmore_stephon.png?itok=9Dl9N_xl&timestamp=1497562813\" class=\"player\">Stephon Gilmore</a></strong> in the base defense. Gilmore and Rowe were solid in coverage, particularly Gilmore who also came up with an excellent tackle to prevent a first down on an early third down. Butler, however, struggled after he forced the early turnover. He allowed <strong>Marvin Jones</strong> to get past him for the Lions first touchdown, a play in which he lost his technique when he looked back for the football.</p>\\n<p>-In the second half the rotations on defense continued, only they moved up front. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/alan-branch\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"350\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"11\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_branch_alan.png?itok=V4ouikNJ&timestamp=1497560349\" class=\"player\">Alan Branch</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/vincent-valentine\" data-player-height=\"6-3\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"DT\" data-player-college=\"Nebraska\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0033_valentine_vincent.png?itok=AMj59au4&timestamp=1497568933\" class=\"player\">Vincent Valentine</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/lawrence-guy\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"305\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Arizona State\" data-player-experience=\"7\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0004_guy_lawrence.png?itok=5gQzsiWr&timestamp=1497562808\" class=\"player\">Lawrence Guy</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcom-brown\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Texas\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_brown_malcom.png?itok=W1beu2Ce&timestamp=1497560349\" class=\"player\">Malcom Brown</a></strong> all saw action with units that generally featured backups throughout the third quarter. The way Branch played he seemed like a veteran who wasn’t all that happy being on the field in such a situation. On his series he overpowered the Lions guard and nearly broke up a running play in the backfield and then followed that with a one-armed sack of Stafford. He soon took a seat on the bench for the rest of the night.</p>\\n<p>-<strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/jordan-richards\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"DB\" data-player-college=\"Stanford\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0001_richards_jordan.png?itok=VZGcTX4v&timestamp=1497567058\" class=\"player\">Jordan Richards</a></strong> opened the night as one of the players who figures to be on the bubble and Belichick and Patricia put him on the field early and often. He was utilized in different ways, operating as a pseudo-linebacker near the line of scrimmage at times. Unfortunately he continues to struggle with his tackling, particularly on <strong>Dwayne Washington’</strong>s 18-yard touchdown reception when he missed badly after a short catch. Richards’ roster spot is by no means safe at this point.</p>\\n<p>-The Patriots coughed up their 24-0 lead and trailed Detroit, 28-24, heading down the stretch. To that point Garoppolo hadn’t moved the ball at all, closing the first half and the entire third quarter without managing a single first down. But as has often been the case with him, the no-huddle attack seemed to serve him well. He led a pair of field goal drives to close the game, the second ending with a 45-yard <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/stephen-gostkowski\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"215\" data-player-position=\"K\" data-player-college=\"Memphis\" data-player-experience=\"12\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0007_gostkowski_stephen.png?itok=A4Tn6OjF&timestamp=1497562876\" class=\"player\">Stephen Gostkowski</a></strong> boot that won it. Garoppolo finished 7 of 12 for 83 yards and did a nice job of handling the late-game situations.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0\\xa0</p>\\n',\n",

We\\'ll try to do our best to kind of, you know, lift his spirits if we can and see what happens.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On the maturation of the team\\'s younger wide receivers: </em><br />\"Yeah, we have a, you know, good group of skill position including tight ends and the backs. Everybody has played different roles at different times throughout the spring and the summer. You know, we\\'re still grinding our way through camp. So this is our fourth week, probably, fifth week, we finished our fifth week. We\\'ve had quite a few practices, but we are still trying to build on what we\\'re, week to week. So, whoever is in there, we have to have confidence in what they\\'re doing. You saw we had a lot of good things from a lot of good, really good players tonight.

Ultimately, the goal of training camp is to be ready for opening week and it\\'ll be here right around the corner.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how pleased he was with the offense starting tonight\\'s game: </em><br />\"Yeah, we, 24 points in the first four drives. Then, you know, we missed the 3rd-and-15. We had a kind of few plays that really sucked and then we had the interception which had sucked too, so. If you take those away, it\\'d be a pretty good night. You know, we\\'d have six pretty good drives there, but we\\'ll learn from them. It\\'s always good to calibrate where you are at and not everything is going to be perfect all the time. You take the lessons you learn from these preseason games and you try to apply them in a couple weeks when it really matters. So, I think the thing about these preseason games is whatever the outcome, you know, none of it\\'s, you know, going to count toward the standing, but you better learn a lot. You better learn what you\\'re all about and who you can count on. You know, it\\'s a good gage at where you\\'re at against other teams.

In 2013, the Lions devoured New England 40-9, after having walloped the Patriots 34-10 two years earlier.</p>\\n<p>Of course, Bill Belichick’s squads advanced to the AFC Championship Game in both seasons, as well as Super Bowl XLVI in 2011. Detroit, meanwhile, lost its wildcard playoff game in ’11 and failed to make the postseason in ’13.</p>\\n<p>So, while third preseason contests are universally regarded as the preseason’s primary tune-ups for the upcoming regular season, they aren’t always perfect indicators of how a team will finish the year.</p>\\n<p>This Friday night in Detroit, it was New England doing almost all the damage, blanking the Lions 24-0 after one quarter of play. However, the one wound the Lions did inflict at the outset could prove to be a significant one.</p>\\n<p>On the game’s opening drive, the Patriots found themselves moving the football with ease against a relatively tame Lions defense. However, wide receiver <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/julian-edelman\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Kent State\" data-player-experience=\"9\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0019_edelman_julian.png?itok=XBS_x3I6&timestamp=1497563247\" class=\"player\">Julian Edelman</a></strong> appeared to suffer a serious injury to his right knee on the possession. The play was a 2nd-and-3 from the Detroit 32. Quarterback <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong> fired a shotgun pass over the middle to Edelman, who made the catch, turned up-field, and encountered a trio of Lions defenders. It looked as if Edelman was hurt when he planted his right leg to avoid a defender.</p>\\n<p>Edelman immediately rolled over on the turf and grabbed his right knee. He managed to lift himself up, but limped noticeably to the Patriots sideline, where he underwent an examination inside a pop-up blue tent (a new feature on NFL sidelines this season).</p>\\n<p>After Edelman was carted off to the locker room for further observation and treatment, the Patriots announced that he was questionable to return to action in the game. He was later declared out and never returned to the field.</p>\\n<p>“You never want to see a guy go down,” tight end <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/rob-gronkowski\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"TE\" data-player-college=\"Arizona\" data-player-experience=\"8\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/2016_500x500_rob_gronkowski2_headshots.png?itok=Mv8mUQY3&timestamp=1464794393\" class=\"player\">Rob Gronkowski</a></strong> lamented later. “Just hope the best for him. Didn’t really see it. I don’t know what’s going on [with him]. Hoping it’s nothing serious.”</p>\\n<p>“I didn’t even see the play,” maintained running back <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/dion-lewis\" data-player-height=\"5-8\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Pittsburgh\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0013_lewis_dion.png?itok=bOx9mQCO&timestamp=1497567313\" class=\"player\">Dion Lewis</a></strong>, “but it’s tough to see that happen to a guy like him who works so hard. I don’t know exactly what it is, but… I saw him get up hobbling. He’s a pretty tough guy, so, I knew it was something [bad]. Whatever it may be, I know he’s going to bounce back. He works hard. He’ll be okay.”</p>\\n<p>Of course, it remains to be seen just how severe this injury is.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_gallery\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_gallery\">\\n    <a id=\"embedded-gallery-584406-304446\" class=\"embedded-gallery\" href=\"http://www.patriots.com/galleries/2017/08/25/patriots-vs-lions-preseason-week-3\" title=\"Patriots vs. Lions: Preseason Week 3\">\\n    \\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-cover-photo field--type-image field--label-hidden\">\\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/media-ap/b3a3a0e1cb904c40a24ba7f63a768e57.jpg\" width=\"2700\" height=\"1900\" />  </div>\\n    <div class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay\">\\n      <div class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay-icon\"></div>\\n      <div class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay-caption\">\\n        <div class =\"embedded-gallery-details\">\\n          <span class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay-subheading\">View gallery</span><span class=\"gallery-count\">84 Slides</span>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class =\"embedded-gallery-title\">\\n          <h3>Patriots vs. Lions: Preseason Week 3</h3>\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </a>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p>In the meantime, it’s not as if New England doesn’t have enough weaponry on offense to survive a potential Edelman loss, regardless of how long he may be out of commission. \\xa0\\xa0Certainly, Brady may miss one of his most reliable targets, and that could change some of what offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels envisioned with a fully loaded arsenal of talent at his disposal. But New England still has <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/rob-gronkowski\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"TE\" data-player-college=\"Arizona\" data-player-experience=\"8\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/2016_500x500_rob_gronkowski2_headshots.png?itok=Mv8mUQY3&timestamp=1464794393\" class=\"player\">Rob Gronkowski</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/brandin-cooks\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"189\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Oregon State\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_cooks_brandin.png?itok=V2AjP1D4&timestamp=1497559914\" class=\"player\">Brandin Cooks</a></strong>, and many others to make plays.</p>\\n<p>What’s most disappointing is that Edelman looked so dominant and was looking to carry that over into the regular season, and perhaps appear in consecutive 16-game seasons for the first time in his career. At this point, that’s still a possibility, provided Friday’s scare is nothing more than that. \\xa0\\xa0</p>\\n<p>In the interim, there was plenty of reason to be encouraged by the performance of the reigning Super Bowl champions.</p>\\n<p>Even after Edelman departed, the offense, under the direction of Brady, carved up the Lions, both through the air and on the ground. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/chris-hogan\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Monmouth (N.J.)\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-2017-hogan-chris-headshot-revised.png?itok=vlWt8xdt&timestamp=1497563672\" class=\"player\">Chris Hogan</a></strong> stepped up on the receiving end of things, with four magnificent grabs, two of which went for touchdowns.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong>’s debut in the Patriots backfield was a resounding success, as he scored on his very first and second touches (a touchdown and ensuing two-point conversion). Coming off a hamstring injury that limited him all spring and summer, the veteran free agent showed a nice combination of speed and power carrying the football.</p>\\n<p>“No matter which one of us is out there, we all make plays: receivers, tight ends, running backs,” declared Gillislee. “All these guys are known for making plays. We saw it tonight, too.”</p>\\n<p>McDaniels and head coach Bill Belichick had to be pleased enough with what they saw that, by halftime, it became clear that the starters would be done for the night.</p>\\n<p>On defense in the first half, when most of the starters on both sides were on the field, \\xa0</p>\\n<p>New England’s pass rush didn’t quite exert itself on Lions QB Matthew Stafford with any consistency, but that was to be expected, given the attrition the Patriots have suffered at that spot this summer.</p>\\n<p>However, the overall play of the cornerbacks stood out. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcolm-butler-0\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"West Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_butler_malcolm.png?itok=qp7y7-vt&timestamp=1497559945\" class=\"player\">Malcolm Butler</a></strong> led them off with a forced fumble on the Lions’ first play. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/stephon-gilmore\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"South Carolina\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0008_gilmore_stephon.png?itok=9Dl9N_xl&timestamp=1497562813\" class=\"player\">Stephon Gilmore</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/eric-rowe\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"205\" data-player-position=\"DB\" data-player-college=\"Utah\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0040_rowe_eric.png?itok=ML3zLcVs&timestamp=1497568195\" class=\"player\">Eric Rowe</a></strong> knocked down and/or intercepted several other Matthew Stafford passes, and all made a number of nice open-field tackles.</p>\\n<p>Yes, Butler surrendered a deep touchdown reception just before halftime, but this secondary is showing the big-play potential that many observers felt was possible heading into 2017.</p>\\n<p>The Lions clawed back fiercely in the second half, but by then, New England was playing all backups. In this game, only the first half of action truly mattered, and what transpired came as no surprise.</p>\\n<p>“It was a good start,” Gronkowski added. “Coming out fast, scoring a touchdown on the first drive – that’s how you want to start a ballgame.”</p>\\n<p>We already expected New England’s offense to be very good, and its defense to be strongest at the back end, with question marks remaining up front. So, it wouldn’t be wise to get too excited or disappointed about anything we witnessed at Ford Field Friday night, with the exception of Edelman’s health status.</p>\\n<p>His injury was the most significant development to result from this game and, until the situation becomes clearer, is sure to dominant discussion as the Patriots return to Foxborough and enter the final week of the preseason.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n',\n",

Almost in every area you turn it over, you give it back to a pretty explosive offense, they move it down and score on you twice within a short period of time. I think in all phases, too many penalties. That first quarter, we were too sloppy. And then we finally got things on track a little bit where we finally got a couple stops defensively and started to move the ball. The way the guys fought back in the second half was good, but we got a lot of things to work on. We just were not as sharp as we\\'d like to be.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On if there was a most frustrating part about trailing 24-0:\\xa0</em><br />\"No, I mean it\\'s a collection of things. We just were ineffective for a stretch there, in all phases, really. Too many penalties on special teams. It backed us up in situations where we may have had a play or two here. Not really sharp as we\\'d like to be on defense. They moved the ball on us pretty easily. And then obviously turning the ball over on offense. Those things were not like what we want to see. We looked a little bit, in some cases particularly kicking game, we had to waste a timeout. You know, a substitution issue. So, it wasn\\'t pretty. But like I said, that part of it was tough, but the guys kind of got settled down and got their feet underneath them and we had three scores in a row in terms of drives. So, they\\'ve shown what they\\'ve always been able to do is come back and get themselves in position and at least give us a chance, which they did.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he takes away from this game about QB Jake Rudock:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, he played well. I mean he made good decisions. They moved the ball consistently with his group and I thought he managed the game well. He was patient and took advantage of opportunities where he could use his legs. He runs well, obviously. But he also delivered a lot of passes along the way. (Jared) Abbrederis made some nice catches for him. Jace Billingsley made some nice catches for him. They had a number of guys that – Tim Wright had a couple here and there. I thought overall he did a nice job. And then obviously Dwayne Washington had a big one to finish it off. He showed some power and elusiveness, so thought that was a good stretch.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he sees from RB Dwayne Washington now opposed to when he first came into the NFL:\\xa0</em><br />\"Well, yeah, I think so. I think he\\'s getting a little bit better because we\\'ve always seen that when he came out of college, we saw that he had the power and speed and the elusiveness and the ability to break tackles and those kinds of things he did from time to time. He did it a little bit more consistently today. He ran behind his pads really well. He had some good, tough yardage. And I think he just continues to get better and better and better. So, he\\'s headed in the right direction.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how Patriots QB <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong> was exploiting the team:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, one of the things, you know, he\\'s as good as they come. I mean, in particularly he\\'s got some guys he can get the ball to. He gets the ball out quickly. He makes quick decisions. You\\'re not going to show him anything he hasn\\'t seen before. I mean, he\\'s just an unusual guy. What you got to do is keep him out of the end zone, which we didn\\'t do. He\\'s going to complete some passes on you. I mean, there hadn\\'t been anybody that\\'s stopped him since he\\'s been in this league. But to be able to slow it down, keep it in front, not have a bunch of mistakes and penalties, and a couple times when they hurry up, they got a couple of advantages on us from just a leverage standpoint which shouldn\\'t happen.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he saw from LB Jarrad Davis:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, I haven\\'t looked at it in detail, but I saw a couple of them, probably the same thing you guys saw. You know, that were the isolated on the inside, and a guy beat him across his face, that kind of thing. But those are the things that you learn. That\\'s what preseason is for. It gives you a chance to look – I don\\'t think anybody\\'s ever said that he\\'s going to be absolutely perfect. You\\'re going to learn along the way. And that\\'s the thing that guys have to be able to learn to deal with is guys that have skills, speed, quickness, size, coming at you nonstop takes a little adjusting. But I think obviously, I think we have some young guys that I think learned a few lessons and we\\'ll get better for it.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On LB Tahir Whitehead\\'s injury status:\\xa0</em><br />\"I wouldn\\'t know exactly until we have an opportunity tomorrow to sit down with the doctors and kind of see where he is.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On TE Cole Wick\\'s injury status:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, same thing. He\\'s been evaluated and we\\'ll kind of see what happens.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how much of a step forward tonight was for RB Theo Riddick:\\xa0</em><br />\"It was good. It was good to get him in there and give him a chance to move around a little bit and I thought he was in position. He had a couple, he had a pretty big one coming and they get a little block at the line of scrimmage. I think (Alan) Branch got his hand up and knocked it down, but Theo I thought did well for his first day out there.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On if RB Ameer Abdullah is one of the bright spots in this preseason:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, I think he does what he does. He creates being able to get in seams, tight seams, and he creates yardage for you. He\\'ll make a guy miss here or there and I think that he\\'s been just coming along, and you can see he\\'s got his quickness and those things, his elusiveness back. So, we\\'re pleased with where he is.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On RB Zach Zenner and S Miles Killebrew not playing much tonight:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, both cases they had a bit of an injury, so we\\'ll see what happens.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On if he liked the information that he gathered about the team from playing against QB <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong>:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, I think that\\'s what preseason is for. I think even during the week when I told you guys that this team is going to challenge us in every single way, so you get a real good barometer of where you are. If you\\'re going to be a real good team in this league then there are some things that you\\'re going to have to deal with consistently and they\\'re going to show them to you, and they attack you in so many different ways that—I think we learned some things, but we know exactly what we have to work on.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On the progression of LB Jalen Reeves-Maybin:\\xa0</em><br />\"I think he\\'s naturally instinctive. So, he finds himself around the ball quite often, and I think it\\'s just a matter of him kind of get him accustomed to how we do things, and he\\'s learning that. He studies and obviously made a really good play on the screen, backed up in their own territory, so he was able to break on the ball and get a pretty good hit on the receiver. So yeah, he\\'s got some talent and got ability, we just got to keep working with him, keep him going.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how to make the opposing quarterback more uncomfortable going forward:\\xa0</em><br />\"You\\'d like to be able to obviously get your pressure with your front four. If you got to bring linebackers and perimeter guys obviously that\\'s all part of what we do as well. But we\\'d like to get a little bit more pressure on him, which we didn\\'t early on. He gets the ball out pretty quick, he\\'s not one of those guys that holds the ball, he\\'s going to get it out. He changes the tempo of the game, so you have to be rather creative in that regard.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On the ongoing process of finding a return man:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, fortunately we have one more week, one more week to kind of make those decisions and we\\'ll kind of look at it and see who we need to see more of, make our evaluations form this game, and try to get in position where we can come to some final conclusions here shortly. So, next week\\'s going to be a big week for us.\"</p>\\n<h2>LIONS QB MATTHEW STAFFORD</h2>\\n<p><em>On the team\\'s tough start in today\\'s game: </em><br />\"Yeah, too many three-and-outs. \\xa0They played us in dime and quarter a lot and weren\\'t able to run the ball successfully there early, where we felt like we had some favorable looks. And then, just weren\\'t converting on third down. I got to do a better job, you know, really everybody does, of keeping those drives going.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how he progressed through the game playing into the third quarter: </em><br />\"We finished off the first half nice, and then obviously came out and got another touchdown second half first drive, which was good. Just hate to start the way you did, but you know, it\\'s football and you just have to find a way to keep battling and we did that.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On RB Ameer Abdullah\\'s play so far this preseason: </em><br />\"Yeah, I think he\\'s done a nice job. You know, he\\'s a talented runner, obviously. Got on the edge a couple times later in the game today for us and did a nice job. Early on, tough sledding a little bit in there, but finished the game nicely.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On his chemistry with WR Marvin Jones Jr.: </em><br />\"Yeah, you know, I think there\\'s always room for improvement, from both of us, and we\\'ll continue to try and keep getting better, but you know, it\\'s nice to throw and complete some balls down the field.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he learned about the offense from this third preseason game: </em><br />\"You know, just got to be better on third down earlier in the game. We go to stay on the field. Obviously, the turnovers hurt us, the fumble, and then obviously, the one—the ball that I threw that got tipped and ended up in their hands, so just got to do a better job of holding on to the ball and converting third downs.\"</p>\\n<p><a class=\"related-story\" href=\"http://www.patriots.com/news/2017/08/25/new-england-patriots-postgame-transcripts-825\">New England Patriots Postgame Quotes 8/25</a></p>\\n<h2>LIONS RB AMEER ABDULLAH</h2>\\n<p><em>On what he can take away from the offense\\'s performance tonight: </em><br />\"You know what, I feel like we did a good job staying composed, got the running game going a little bit and started doing what we know to do. We started converting third downs, that\\'s huge. I feel like we\\'re a really good third-down team and early on we weren\\'t that great. So, I feel like we kind of settled down. We didn\\'t let things get too big for us. We just settled down and just went back to what we knew how to do. It\\'s convert, get all the blocks, make all our right reads in our run plays and it came along.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On looking like he is getting into his groove: </em><br />\"My groove is coming along. I don\\'t think I\\'m all the way there, yet. My eyes haven\\'t been the best to my standard. It\\'s coming along and it\\'s encouraging.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what RB Dwayne Washington showed tonight: </em><br />\"He\\'s a dog. I mean, I\\'ve said it before. I feel like he\\'s athletically a very good player. He\\'s a guy who hasn\\'t played running back that long. He went to (the University of) Washington to play receiver and then later in his career he started playing running back and he\\'s still learning. He\\'s molding into the player he\\'s becoming, the player you all saw tonight.\"</p>\\n',\n",

At some point in the near future, perhaps as soon as 2019, the Broncos\\' owner for the last 33 years should take his place with the legends of the game.</p> <p>But the wait will not end next year.</p> <p>Bowlen was not chosen as the Contributors Committee nominee for the 2018 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. The committee instead opted to nominate former Washington and San Diego general manager Bobby Beathard, whose candidacy will be considered at the meeting of the full Selection Committee next Feb. 3 in Minneapolis, one day before Super Bowl LII.</p> <p><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"aa47333e-3267-4fed-91e3-1ef4344902ec\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"0\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>The Contributors Committee bypassed Bowlen for this year despite the fact that his contributions to the league were legion, as he helped lift the entire NFL to new heights of prominence and prosperity, particularly in his roles on the NFL Finance Committee, the NFL Business Ventures Committee and his work as chairman of the NFL Broadcasting Committee.</p> <p>In that role he handled negotiations on an $18 billion contract and helped lay the groundwork for making \"Sunday Night Football\" the primary prime-time game each week; as a result, <i>SNF</i> has been the highest-rated program on television for six consecutive seasons.</p> <p>But as Bowlen said on March 23, 1984 -- the day he met the media for the first time as Broncos owner -- \"Winning is more important than making money.\"</p> <p>The first task was team success, and from a 13-3 season in his first year on the job through his 21st winning season last season, the accomplishments have accumulated quicker than the 300 wins he achieved faster than any owner in NFL history.</p> <p><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"5aaeff4d-4452-420d-b307-29ff0a55cd04\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"0\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>• Three Super Bowl wins<br />• Seven conference championships<br />• More Super Bowl appearances (seven) than losing seasons (five)<br />• Thirteen division titles<br />• Eighteen playoff appearances<br />• Most regular-season wins in the NFL<br />• Highest home attendance in the NFL since 1984</p> <p>Bowlen\\'s resume is that of a Hall of Famer, and with the Contributors Committee able to nominate two people for the 2019 Hall of Fame class, his time for induction could come soon.</p> <p>In the meantime, the Broncos will remain underrepresented in the Hall of Fame.</p> <p>Terrell Davis\\' induction earlier this month brought the total number of Hall members inducted at least in part for their contributions as Broncos to five. But that number pales in comparison with other franchises that also began play in the 1960s such as the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs (14 Hall of Famers), Minnesota Vikings (13 Hall of Famers), San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers (10 Hall of Famers) and Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans (10 Hall of Famers).</p> <p>Those clubs have as many Super Bowl appearances combined (eight) as the Broncos do on their own. They have a single world championship among themselves; the Broncos have three.</p> <p>Yet they average 11.75 Hall of Famers, a number that is almost certain to rise thanks to the Seniors Committee\\'s nomination of Oilers linebacker Robert Brazile as a finalist for the 2018 class.</p> <p>Life, and the Hall of Fame, aren\\'t fair. And now Bowlen\\'s wait, just like that of other deserving Broncos legends such as Steve Atwater, John Lynch, Randy Gradishar, Louis Wright and Karl Mecklenburg, will continue.</p>',\n",

It means responsibility, class, and professionalism. It means taking every opportunity that comes your way and running with the chance to make a difference in your community. Being a DBC means being a person of action, being beautiful inside and out and showing the kindness in your heart to not only Denver, but all of Broncos Country.</p> <p><strong>Who is your hero?</strong></p> <p>Every member of my family performs acts of heroism every day, but this year I will talk about my parents. My parents are the epitome of selfless. They have given up everything so that my sisters and I can live happy lives, full of love and comfort. They never say no when anyone asks for help and inspire me to be just as giving as they are. My parents are truly one-of-a-kind individuals that live their lives in outstanding yet humbling ways.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about the first concert you’ve ever been to?</strong></p> <p>The first concert I ever went to was Spice Girls. I was probably about 4 or 5 years old. But the first concert I remember going to was Ed Sheeran in college. He sat on the floor with us and played his guitar. It was amazing.</p> <p><strong>If there were a movie made about your life, which celebrity would you want to play you? Who would play your parents?</strong></p> <p>If my life was a movie, I think I would be played by Jordana Brewster. We look a little similar, and I think she always represents herself with class. My mother would be played by Jennifer Aniston because neither of them seem to ever age, and they are both positive, outstanding role models. My father would be played by Steve Martin because my dad is exactly like the father Steve played in Father of the Bride. I have the best parents in the world.</p> <p><strong>What is your dream vacation destination?</strong></p> <p>I would love to see New Zealand and Australia. I have never been to either and think they would provide a trip full of adventure and new experiences.</p> <p><strong>Any hidden talents or tricks you can do?</strong></p> <p>I can do some cool tricks when it comes to acrobatics, but that’s about it!</p> <p><strong>When did you first start dancing/cheerleading?</strong></p> <p>I started dancing at 2 years old, and I never stopped. My dance training continued through college where I earned my Bachelors of Fine Arts in Dance. After college, I joined the Broncos!</p> <p><strong>In 10 years I see myself…</strong></p> <p>I know I will be looking back at my time as a Denver Broncos Cheerleader and be so thankful for the friendships I made, experiences I was given, and lessons I learned.</p> <p><strong>As a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></p> <p>I wanted to be a dentist for most of my childhood. I think there was a brief period of time where I thought I wanted to be a firefighter. In reality, I think I wanted to make a successful future for myself like my parents had, and I gravitated towards a career that would find me stability, even as a kid.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give your younger self?</strong></p> <p>Don’t make excuses. You are perfect the way you are; you don’t need to make an excuses for not being exactly like everyone else.</p>',\n",

all in on the Patriots shiny new acquisition.

That\\'s an important factor when trying to determine who will lead the Patriots in catches because Brady needs to feel comfortable when he throws you the football. Once he does the sky\\'s the limit.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Based on the early returns that won\\'t be a problem, and once Brady sees how productive Cooks is, he will continue feeding him throughout the season. Cooks can catch it long, short and anywhere in between and his first season as a Patriot will be a memorable one for all involved.\\xa0<br /><em>- AH</em></p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<h2><div class=\"image-fpp image-fpp-583951\">\\n<figure class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_photo align-left margin-5 width-50\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_photo align-left margin-5 width-50\">\\n    <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-photo field--type-image field--label-hidden\"><div class=\"field__items\"><div class=\"field__item even\"><img class=\"borealis image-style-no_limit borealis-js\" data-borealis-respondsmall=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondsmall/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=yVuGzky8&timestamp=1439440708\" data-borealis-respondmedium=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondmedium/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=zG0Q2WUh&timestamp=1439777254\" data-borealis-respondlarge=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondlarge/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=i73huI0r&timestamp=1441994736\" data-borealis-respondxl=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=TmU-ygwV&timestamp=1442000146\" data-borealis-respondxl2=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl2/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=MvLb9Dgs&timestamp=1447437196\" data-borealis-respondxl3=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl3/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=iDYxB7z9&timestamp=1447646950\" data-borealis-respondxl4=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl4/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=OdWB9iRY&timestamp=1447646950\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondsmall/public/80x80-paul-perillo-headshot-2015_0.png?itok=yVuGzky8&timestamp=1439440708\"/></div></div></div></figure>\\n</div>\\nPFW\\'s Paul Perillo says ...</h2>\\n<p><strong>JULIAN EDELMAN</strong></p>\\n<p><div class=\"image-fpp image-fpp-583961\">\\n<figure class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_photo align-right margin-5 width-50\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_photo align-right margin-5 width-50\">\\n    <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-photo field--type-image field--label-hidden\"><div class=\"field__items\"><div class=\"field__item even\"><img class=\"borealis image-style-no_limit borealis-js\" data-borealis-respondsmall=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondsmall/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=47W53u4U&timestamp=1503687958\" data-borealis-respondmedium=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondmedium/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=yQ7iZMX9&timestamp=1503688414\" data-borealis-respondlarge=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondlarge/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=3Kn02pFP&timestamp=1503783813\" data-borealis-respondxl=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=StSgfQLh&timestamp=1503783813\" data-borealis-respondxl2=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl2/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=Guc0Q35I&timestamp=1503783813\" data-borealis-respondxl3=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl3/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=LD1nVNcn&timestamp=1503783813\" data-borealis-respondxl4=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondxl4/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=gPhHyBUP&timestamp=1503783813\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/borealis_no_limit_respondsmall/public/media-ap/3eadba532afc42e7960832c05082adb6.jpg?itok=47W53u4U&timestamp=1503687958\"/></div></div></div><figcaption class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n\\n  \\n      <p>Patriots WR Julian Edelman.

As such, the report speculates that veteran newcomer <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/david-harris\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"250\" data-player-position=\"LB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"11\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-david-harris-bio-headshot.png?itok=glPaTSea&timestamp=1498172841\" class=\"player\">David Harris</a></strong> could have a big role in the middle of the defense in Detroit.</p>\\n<p>While Hightower is working back into the mix after missing all of training camp and the two previous preseason games on PUP, Roberts is dealing with a rib injury that saw him carted off the field last Saturday night in Houston. McClellin has been absent with an unknown injury since early in camp that’s now forced the veteran to miss three preseason games.</p>\\n<p>Previously, <strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4805041/with-nate-solder-not-traveling-tom-bradys-blindside-bears-watching\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN also reported that Nate Solder</a></strong>, who returned to practice this week after an extended absence to an unknown issue, did not travel, either. As such, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cameron-fleming\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Stanford\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0015_fleming_cameron.png?itok=uPJUryJC&timestamp=1497563348\" class=\"player\">Cameron Fleming</a></strong> is expected to once again be charged with protecting <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong>’s blind side against the Lions.</p>\\n<p>While Hightower, Solder, Roberts and McClellin will all apparently be out of action, New England could see running back <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong> make his debut in Detroit. The free agent addition has missed most of training camp and two preseason games to a hamstring injury that dates back to the spring, but he returned to the practice field on Tuesday and deemed himself “100-percent.”</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n',\n",

Sometimes he plays just the first half. Others he plays, comes out and then returns in the third quarter. There have even been times when he\\'s played a full three quarters. Regardless, this will be the best chance to see Brady in extended action with his new-look offense. Seeing him find a rhythm is important. Of course seeing him stay upright and healthy is even more important.</p>\\n<p><strong>Tackle football </strong>- Left tackle <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/nate-solder\" data-player-height=\"6-8\" data-player-weight=\"325\" data-player-position=\"T\" data-player-college=\"Colorado\" data-player-experience=\"7\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0038_solder_nate.png?itok=oveSJ7Er&timestamp=1497567994\" class=\"player\">Nate Solder</a></strong> returned to practice this week, but reportedly did not travel to Detroit. That means <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cameron-fleming\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Stanford\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0015_fleming_cameron.png?itok=uPJUryJC&timestamp=1497563348\" class=\"player\">Cameron Fleming</a></strong> will once again likely be protecting Brady\\'s blind side. Fleming has been up and down at various times this summer. The rest of the returning offensive line starters should be on the field for extended action in front of their 40-year-old passer, but it\\'s Fleming who\\'s most in the spotlight. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/laadrian-waddle\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"315\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Texas Tech\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0030_waddle_laadrian.png?itok=aQG8bQj9&timestamp=1497567914\" class=\"player\">LaAdrian Waddle</a></strong> returned to practice after missing a week due to a reported concussion, while rookie <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tony-garcia\" data-player-height=\"6-7\" data-player-weight=\"302\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Troy\" data-player-experience=\"Rookie\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0011_garcia_tony.png?itok=c-RkvAsg&timestamp=1497563236\" class=\"player\">Tony Garcia</a></strong> remains out of action with an unknown injury. The depth at the tackle spot remains a competitive summer battle. Still, Fleming keeping Brady clean might be goal No. 1 on the Patriots To-Do List in Detroit.</p>\\n<p><strong>No big plays </strong>- Both the first unit defenders and the backups for the Patriots defense have been allowing big plays this summer. That\\'s not what Belichick and Matt Patricia are looking for. One of the main tenets of the defensive system in New England is not allowing big plays. The time to clean up the issue is now, not when the games begin to count in a couple weeks. The Lions have the weapons to make plays, so New England will have to play better to achieve this goal. That means much better coverage and much better tackling.</p>\\n<p><strong>On edge</strong> - The competition to fill out the depth chart on the edge of the Patriots defense is ongoing. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/trey-flowers\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Arkansas\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0014_flowers_trey.png?itok=6Py8Daj5&timestamp=1497563425\" class=\"player\">Trey Flowers</a></strong> sat out the first two games. His debut in Detroit would ease questions about his health and how ready he is to be Da Man at defensive end. Otherwise it\\'s a continued mixing and matching of bodies to see what mix works. Kony Ealy gets another chance to prove his worth. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/harvey-langi\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"252\" data-player-position=\"LB\" data-player-college=\"Brigham Young\" data-player-experience=\"Rookie\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0015_langi_harvey.png?itok=xYrJ31Fk&timestamp=1497568324\" class=\"player\">Harvey Langi</a></strong> too. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/donta-hightower\" data-player-height=\"6-3\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"LB\" data-player-college=\"Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0000_hightower_donta.png?itok=zts2lz5x&timestamp=1497562797\" class=\"player\">Dont\\'a Hightower</a></strong> could very well have a role on the edge, and his return to practice from PUP was a good sign this week even if he\\'d seem unlikely to jump right into extended game action. There\\'s a serious lack of proven talent and depth on the edge of the defense and figuring out how to overcome that will be a priority, though it\\'s a process that will likely continue well into the regular season.</p>\\n<p><strong>In the running </strong>- <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong> returned to practice this week after missing the first two preseason games and plenty of practice action with a hamstring injury. The veteran newcomer deemed himself 100-percent healthy. That could mean at least a few snaps and carries in Detroit. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/rex-burkhead\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Nebraska\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_burkhead_rex.png?itok=NRUes3A_&timestamp=1497560323\" class=\"player\">Rex Burkhead</a></strong> had a big role in the first offense last week in Houston, but did not practice this week.

It\\'s a crowded, talented backfield and Friday night\\'s action could give another hint to how the competition at running back might be playing out.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bounce back, Butler </strong>- <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcolm-butler-0\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"West Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_butler_malcolm.png?itok=qp7y7-vt&timestamp=1497559945\" class=\"player\">Malcolm Butler</a></strong> struggled in limited action in his summer debut last week in Houston. The former Pro Bowler has had an otherwise solid summer, but seeing him do it on the game field against Matthew Stafford and Co. would alieve any fears fans may have that the fourth-year player is headed toward anything other than an impressive season. The Patriots secondary is expected to be the strength of the defense. Butler and his fellow veteran brethren can measure themselves against a Detroit passing attack that ranked No. 11 in the NFL a year ago.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jimmy\\'s ball security </strong>- <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/jimmy-garoppolo\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Eastern Illinois\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0010_garoppolo_jimmy.png?itok=wXGE4X3l&timestamp=1497563177\" class=\"player\">Jimmy Garoppolo</a></strong> wasn\\'t pleased with himself last week after an interception and lost fumble in Houston. The backup has turned the ball over a bit too often on the practice field this summer, as well. Though Friday night will be a big dose of Brady, whenever Garoppolo gets in the game the fourth-year No. 2 needs to take care of the ball. Turnovers and big mistakes are the difference between winning and losing in the NFL. At some point, somewhere, Garoppolo is going to be a starter. Ball security is a focal point any time he\\'s on the field from here on out.</p>\\n<p><strong>Competition continues</strong> - Though many believe that the bulk of the Patriots 53-man roster that will be announced on Sept. 3 is already locked up, there clearly is still some competition at various spots. That includes battles at defensive end, tight end, running back, backup tackle and in depth/special teams roles to fill out the roster. There is pressure for many guys to perform well to try to nail down at job. But as Belichick pointed out this week, life in the NFL is all about pressure.</p>\\n<p><strong>More Cyrus</strong> - Second-year former second-round pick <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cyrus-jones\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0023_jones_cyrus.png?itok=KUx5hJfu&timestamp=1497567532\" class=\"player\">Cyrus Jones</a></strong> had a terrible start to the summer in the first preseason game, allowing a 97-yard touchdown. He was much better last week, earning positive reviews from Belichick with his work in the return game. The young playmaker needs to string together positive plays and games, regardless of what role he\\'s in. Jones is one of the more notable supposed \\'bubble” guys as the preseason process winds down. After last week his arrow is pointing up. Can he keep that momentum going?</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video width-100\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video width-100\">\\n    \\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-video field--type-file field--label-hidden\">\\n    <div class=\"media-nflc-video media-nflc-fpp-583931\">\\n  <nflcs:avplayer id=\"avplayer-extended\"\\n        data-config=\"http://www.patriots.com/media/nflc-config.json\"\\n    data-contentId=\"fpp-583931\"\\n    data-autoplay=\"false\"\\n    data-pr=\"0\"    data-offset=\"0\"    data-companion=\"1\"\\n    data-channelkey=\"Video_Press_Conference\"\\n    data-channelid=\"2316\"\\n    data-adtagsuffix=\"\"\\n    data-playername=\"media-player-embed\"\\n    data-chromeless=\"\"\\n    data-mediatype=\"video\"\\n        data-videoID=\"3735b5cf-c507-4b94-969a-4402caf0bb36\"        class=\"nflcs-avplayer\"\\n    ></nflcs:avplayer>\\n</div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n    Tom Brady 8/23: \\'I\\'ve been fortunate to do what I love\\'   </div>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p><strong>Air it out</strong> - Brady and new speedy receiver <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/brandin-cooks\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"189\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Oregon State\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_cooks_brandin.png?itok=V2AjP1D4&timestamp=1497559914\" class=\"player\">Brandin Cooks</a></strong> have connected with regularity for big plays on the practice field this summer. But we\\'ve yet to see that in a preseason game. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/chris-hogan\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Monmouth (N.J.)\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-2017-hogan-chris-headshot-revised.png?itok=vlWt8xdt&timestamp=1497563672\" class=\"player\">Chris Hogan</a></strong> has also had his share of big plays on the practice field, as has <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/rob-gronkowski\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"TE\" data-player-college=\"Arizona\" data-player-experience=\"8\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/2016_500x500_rob_gronkowski2_headshots.png?itok=Mv8mUQY3&timestamp=1464794393\" class=\"player\">Rob Gronkowski</a></strong>. There is no doubt that the Patriots passing game has huge big-play potential this fall, well beyond the catch-and-run success we saw from the running backs last week. It might be nice to see a tiny sample of Brady and Co. getting the ball down the field against the Lions on Friday night.

The defining characteristic that will determine who gets the roster spots on the offensive line behind the starters? Versatility.</p> <p>\"That\\'s very important,” Joseph said. \"Obviously, the first five is your starters, but you want guys in the second five that can play multiple positions, like a swing tackle or a big guard who can play some tackle, so that\\'s definitely critical.

Roster construction, particularly beyond the starting lineup on offense and defense, is also a delicate balance that accounts for factors beyond the answer to the simple question of whether a player is good enough to make the team.</p> <p>\"I want the best guys for the roster,” Joseph said. \"Sometimes when you\\'re building a roster, you make decisions on how well they play for [Special Teams Coordinator] Brock [Olivo], smarts, guys staying healthy. So those things come into play when you\\'re building a roster, not just the promising, talented guy.</p> <p>\"It can be a guy that\\'s a smart guy that can help you in all phases.

The tough Nebraska product has developed quite the following during his short time in Denver, and he took a few minutes during a training camp to speak with us. Luckily, our recording device didn’t meet the same fate as many of his facemasks.</i></p> <p><b>Aric DiLalla: </b><i><b>Going into your second year, what do you think is going to change the most for you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>Andy Janovich: </strong>“[It’s the] same mentality, just go downhill, hit linebackers and win games. It’s pretty simple.”</p> <p><b>AD: </b><i><b>How does the role of the fullback change in Offensive Coordinator Mike McCoy’s offense?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “There’s a lot more formations that I’m put in, a little bit more in the pass game. But the run is fairly the same.”</p> <p><i><b><b><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"cc3f164b-7092-4cef-aa14-4d5f71905be4\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"3\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>AD: </b>What sort of change has that been for you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “A little different, because I’m not a guy that they usually ask to run a whole bunch of routes. So working on that’s a little different for me.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>What’s it been like to keep Running Backs Coach/Assistant Head Coach Eric Studesville as a holdover from the previous staff?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> \"It’s great. I know what to expect with him. He’s a great coach, I’ve heard from a lot of guys around the league that their coaches don’t do what he does, like give them cut ups for game days and just all the extra stuff that he gives us about linebackers in film study. He goes above and beyond.\"</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>What’s been the best thing he’s taught you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “He knows exactly what to look for, how to diagnose a play, what the linebacker’s running. He’s really good about that.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>During training camp, Special Teams Coordinator Brock Olivo raved about your work ethic. How’d it feel to have a coach talk about you like that?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “I thought it was pretty cool -- coming out here every day just working and knowing that it’s not going unnoticed. It makes you feel good about yourself.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>How is it different playing under Olivo than it was to play for former special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “Great. [Olivo is] a little different than Joe D. He doesn’t yell as much. He just talks to you. He’ll walk you through a play if you don’t understand it. He’s a great coach and I enjoy having him here.”</p> <p><i><b><b><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"afc91035-0594-43c9-9901-90d170fae9ea\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"3\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>AD: </b>You’ve gathered a bit of a cult following here in Denver. What’s it been like to see the fans adopt you the way they have?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “Any time you get fan support, it’s great. That’s what you’re out here for is playing for fans. They appreciate everything that you do, everything that you put in. When they appreciate that, it’s pretty awesome. It reminds me a little bit of [my alma mater] Nebraska. Nebraska loves the fullback too, so it’s awesome.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>Where does that appreciation for the fullback come from?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “I really, I don’t know what it is. But it’s got to start with a touchdown. After I scored against Wisconsin, people went nuts about that, because they never give the fullback the ball. So I think they saw that and got pretty excited, like they were back in the \\'90s.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>Against Kansas City last year in Week 12, you suffered an ankle injury during the first series and stayed in the rest of the game. From both a mental and physical perspective, what was that game like for you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “It’s tough to come out. I’ve never actually had torn ligaments in my ankle. I just thought I sprained my ankle. It’s hard to say, ‘Man, I should pull myself.’ But looking back at the film, I should’ve, because I wasn’t really going full speed. I couldn’t do my job as well as I could’ve. They could’ve put somebody in there to do a better job. Looking back, I probably should’ve come out.”</p>',\n",

In the months following the Super Bowl but before the regular season, they sometimes find themselves flipping through the television channels looking to fill a football-shaped void; they wonder how long they have to wait until kickoff.</p>\\n<p>This week, Gronk embodies this exact sentiment perfectly in an unlikely place: Katy Perry\\'s new music video.</p>\\n<p>Katy released the official video for her new song \"Swish Swish\" featuring Nicki Minaj, and in it, she and a misfit basketball team coached by former SNL player Molly Shannon face off against an all-star team led by actor Terry Crews. As the team gets pummeled in the first half, the camera pans to the crowd, and there we see Gronk holding a sign that says it all, \"When does football season start?\"</p>\\n<p>Katy\\'s team eventually turns it around with some unconventional methods, but for Patriots fans, it\\'ll be their tight end who steals the show.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>This isn\\'t the first time this summer Gronk has been at the forefront of pop music. Earlier in the offseason, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/news/2017/07/19/gronk-celebrates-demi-lovato-her-new-single\" target=\"_blank\">Gronk helped Demi Lovato</a></strong> host a house party to celebrate her new single, \"Sorry Not Sorry.\"\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Gronk wasn\\'t the only familiar face in the star-studded video. Hot dog eating champ Joey Chestnut, Timberwolf Karl-Anthony Towns, Bill Walton, Rich Eisen, Doug the Pug and Gaten Matarazzo, who plays Dustin in \"Stranger Things,\" were just some of the famous faces in the video.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Though Gronk\\'s role in \"Swish Swish\" was brief, it is a great reason for Patriots fans to jam to Katy\\'s new song. You can check out the music video below.\\xa0</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGk5fR-t5AU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGk5fR-t5AU</a></p>\\n',\n",

And Thomas responded positively.</p> <p>“It means a lot,” Thomas said in April. \"Definitely, the first thing I thought was more opportunities and chances to get the ball more, but also be that guy to get the offense sparking. I’m excited about it and I look forward to it. I just have to step up to the plate.”</p> <p><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"a775f323-bace-4a90-9a38-14aa5812875f\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"3\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>Months later, Thomas remains a focal point for the offense, and the expectations have only grown.</p> <p>“D.T. looks phenomenal, and I’ve got huge expectations for him,” said Offensive Coordinator Mike McCoy on Wednesday after practice. “I think he understands, and I understand, what the expectations are of this organization and the type of offense and the type of team we need to have.”</p> <p>Thomas, who owns the NFL’s longest active streak of 1,000-yard receiving seasons, provides more than just an elite option on the outside.</p> <p>“He’s the leader of the group,” McCoy said. “Him and Emmanuel [Sanders] both — they set the standard for this offense. The way we’re going to work, the way we’re going to practice. They’re so competitive and I think that’s the great thing about this team, is the way they practice against one another. All offseason long, all through the OTAs, the minicamp, through training camp, it’s been so competitive. Not just D.T., but Emmanuel and the standard they set.”</p> <p>The last time McCoy featured Thomas in his offense, the then-second-year wide receiver caught 94 passes for 1,434 yards and 10 touchdowns on his way to his first Pro-Bowl selection.</p> <p>Five years later, McCoy sees the same player.</p> <p>“D.T. played that way when we were together back in the day,” McCoy said. “Him and Virgil [Green] are the only two guys left remaining on offense, but I just love the way he works, and I’m looking forward to D.T. having a phenomenal year.”</p>',\n",

And rather than let a well-respected leader get away, the Broncos made sure he’d have a home in Denver for a long time. Replacing Wade Phillips is no easy task, but Woods seems to be up to that challenge. In his first year as a defensive coordinator, Woods will look to sprinkle some sugar on a defense that still has great elements but needs a tweak after 2016. We caught up with Woods to hear about his vision heading into a bounce-back year for the Broncos.</em></p> <p><b>Aric DiLalla: <i>Have you learned anything about yourself during the process of getting ready to be defensive coordinator?</i></b></p> <p><strong>Joe Woods: </strong>I think just everything I absorbed just from the front to the back end [of the defense]. When you’re a secondary coach, you tend to focus on the things that you have to have your guys do to have success. But along the way, you pick up things that they do up front [at] the D-line, linebacker position. So I felt like I had a good idea of what we did scheme-wise with the front seven.</p> <p><img src=\"/assets/images/imported/DEN/photos/centerpiece/homepage/2017/170823_woods1.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\" width=\"384\" /></p> <p><b>AD: <i>What’s something you want fans to know about their new defensive coordinator?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>Just that I’m a hard worker, I’m very passionate, I’m going to put the time in, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure this defense stays at the level that they have been [at in] the last two years.</p> <p><b>AD: <i>Do you have a new appreciation for the type of player <nobr><a href=\"/team/roster/von-miller/036470c3-df00-47e4-a936-86200f2c88dc/\"  rel=\"/cda-web/person-card-module.htm?mode=data&id=036470c3-df00-47e4-a936-86200f2c88dc\" rev=\"player\" title=\"Von Miller\" class=\"player-card-tooltip\"><span>Von Miller</span><img src=\"/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif\"></a></nobr> is now that you’ve studied more of the defense as a whole?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>No, not really – the whole philosophy when you’re a secondary coach is rush and coverage work together. So if we cover, we buy time for him to get home. And sometimes he gets home and allows us to cover easily. He’s always been a great player. I’ve known that since the time I’ve been here, and it’s just great to have somebody of his caliber.</p> <p><strong>AD:</strong><i><b> I wrote down some of the places you coached before you joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. You’ve got Kent State, Grand Valley State, Eastern Michigan, Muskingum College -- a lot of smaller schools. And then you went straight to Tampa. How’d that happen?</b></i></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>My position coach in college, when I graduated, asked me if I ever wanted to coach. That was John Bowers, and I said, ‘Hey, I’ll give it a shot.’ And from that moment when I graduated, I’ve been coaching ever since. For me, when you coach and you coach at every level, you really have to be a good teacher. Because sometimes you’re getting players like a DB who may have been a wide receiver. … So I think throughout my career at different stops, I really learned from a lot of good coaches how to be a really good teacher.</p> <p><strong>AD:</strong> <i><b>Was that jump to the NFL a tough adjustment?</b></i></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>I found it easy. I know you have to be a great coach at any level. I’m not saying that [because] I coached smaller I-AA, Division II schools that I’m a better coach than somebody who coached at a major college level, but I think the different type of guys, the different places that I’ve been, I think it made my jump easy to the NFL because I was already, in my opinion, a good fundamental coach [and] a good technician, in terms of being a coach.</p> <p><img src=\"/assets/images/imported/DEN/photos/centerpiece/homepage/2017/08-August/170823_woods3.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\" width=\"384\" /></p> <p><b>AD: <i>Did your players at the NFL level respond the same way they did in college?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>The biggest thing a player wants to know is, can you help them make plays? Can you help them be a better football player? So first they look at you and say, ‘Can this guy really help me?’ Once you get into the season, and the things you’re teaching them, they use in a game and you see the results in terms of them making plays, that’s when the buy-in comes in.</p> <p><b>AD:<i> The promotion to defensive coordinator is obviously big for you, but what’s it been like to share that with your family?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>They’re excited. My wife’s been with me the whole time. She loves sports. She really loves to move around more than I do to the different places that we’ve been, and we’ve been all over. But I have a tremendous amount of support from my wife, a tremendous amount of support from my kids and it’s been a great experience for us in Denver.</p> <p><b>AD: <i>What’s it like to develop a script? I know you’ve done some work on that before under former defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, but has working on that as the coordinator been a change for you?</i></b></p> <p><b>JW:</b> No, it’s easy. We all had different responsibilities as position coaches under Wade. He had a lot of trust in us. He gave us a lot of responsibility in terms of what we wanted to run in different situations, so it’s really kind of the same approach with each guy being responsible for their area. I’ll overlook everything, make sure that we have everything from a game-plan standpoint the way we need it, but so far it’s been an easy transition.”<img src=\"/assets/images/imported/DEN/photos/centerpiece/homepage/2017/08-August/170823_woods2.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" width=\"575\" /></p>',\n",

He doesn\\'t expect to play in the preseason, but if he\\'s ready for Week 1, the Broncos can breathe easier knowing they have a proven contributor with starting experience in their scheme playing on Miller\\'s opposite side.</p> <p>\"He can do a lot of the things that I can do out there,\" Miller said.</p> <p>... With this being a simulation of a regular-season week, the Broncos ditched the first-team-vs.-first-team repetitions that defined nearly all of their practices from OTAs through last week.</p> <p>The No. 1 offense and defense worked against scout-team units that mimicked the Packers\\' tactics, as is typical of regular-season preparation.</p> <p>...

Joseph said he expects to work Charles into the first 15 snaps of the game.</p> <p>The Broncos have monitored Charles\\' repetitions closely throughout the last few weeks as they look to see how the 10-year veteran\\'s knee responds to an increased workload. But Charles himself has tried to put the knee out of his mind.</p> <p>\"I\\'m not even worrying about it,\" he said. \"If [an injury] happens again, it happens.

His first carry was a 1-yard touchdown, followed immediately by a two-point conversion on essentially the same play. Later in the first half he showed nice burst on a 27-yard run to finish the night with 38 yards on his eight attempts. If Gillislee can stay healthy he has already shown the ability to get into the end zone, including in goal line drills in practice early in camp, and also take advantage of opportunities that will come to him as a runner in the pass-first attack. Nice first impression for the former Bills backup who led the NFL with 5.7 yards per carry last year.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\">\\n    \\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-video field--type-file field--label-hidden\">\\n    <div class=\"media-nflc-video media-nflc-fpp-584461\">\\n  <nflcs:avplayer id=\"avplayer-extended\"\\n        data-config=\"http://www.patriots.com/media/nflc-config.json\"\\n    data-contentId=\"fpp-584461\"\\n    data-autoplay=\"false\"\\n    data-pr=\"3\"    data-offset=\"0\"    data-companion=\"1\"\\n    data-channelkey=\"Video_NFL\"\\n    data-channelid=\"2256\"\\n    data-adtagsuffix=\"\"\\n    data-playername=\"media-player-embed\"\\n    data-chromeless=\"\"\\n    data-mediatype=\"video\"\\n        data-videoID=\"1c2c429c-dcd0-4aa7-abe9-5a20307c1444\"        class=\"nflcs-avplayer\"\\n    ></nflcs:avplayer>\\n</div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n    Mike Gillislee runs for 27-yard gain  </div>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p><strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong> –</strong><em> </em>Not that there is any question about Brady’s ability at the age of 40 – unless you are a hot-take TV show host – but T12 continues to show his stuff and prove he’s going to lead an elite passing attack once again in 2017. Other than a punt-like interception on his final throw of the night, Brady was on point leading the fast start. Five throws into the night Brady was 5-for-5 with 91 yards and two touchdowns.

He’s not had a great summer and that continued in Detroit. Richards was used in more of a linebacker or in-the-box role against the Lions, unfortunately his tackling wasn’t exactly what you look for in that spot. His missed tackle keyed Dwayne Washington’s catch-and-run 18-yard touchdown.

In fact, each had key positive plays in the win. Butler punched a ball out of Golden Tate’s hands on Detroit’s first offensive play, helping build the big early lead. Then Gostkowski nailed the game-winning kick, his third made field goal of the night. But each is held to a higher standard. For Butler, that means his 23-yard touchdown allowed to Marvin Jones isn’t good enough, especially after last week’s struggles in coverage against the Texans. Gostkowski missed a PAT in the first quarter, his second missed PAT this summer and third missed kick overall. Both players are still elite players, but they are also held to a higher standard. They can and will be better.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\">\\n    \\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-video field--type-file field--label-hidden\">\\n    <div class=\"media-nflc-video media-nflc-fpp-584471\">\\n  <nflcs:avplayer id=\"avplayer-extended\"\\n        data-config=\"http://www.patriots.com/media/nflc-config.json\"\\n    data-contentId=\"fpp-584471\"\\n    data-autoplay=\"false\"\\n    data-pr=\"3\"    data-offset=\"0\"    data-companion=\"1\"\\n    data-channelkey=\"Video_NFL\"\\n    data-channelid=\"2256\"\\n    data-adtagsuffix=\"\"\\n    data-playername=\"media-player-embed\"\\n    data-chromeless=\"\"\\n    data-mediatype=\"video\"\\n        data-videoID=\"f0cb4900-1e77-4da8-b0b8-1fe6c3dcc8db\"        class=\"nflcs-avplayer\"\\n    ></nflcs:avplayer>\\n</div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n    Stephen Gostkowski kicks game winning field goal  </div>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p><em>What do you think of our lists?

The offense opened the game with <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong> at his surgical best, completing all four of his passes for 59 yards during a 75-yard touchdown drive. The march included a nice mix of <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/dion-lewis\" data-player-height=\"5-8\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Pittsburgh\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0013_lewis_dion.png?itok=bOx9mQCO&timestamp=1497567313\" class=\"player\">Dion Lewis</a></strong> runs with passes to <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/julian-edelman\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Kent State\" data-player-experience=\"9\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0019_edelman_julian.png?itok=XBS_x3I6&timestamp=1497563247\" class=\"player\">Julian Edelman</a></strong> (more on him in a moment) with Brady operating at times with tempo and the no huddle approach. The Patriots had Detroit scrambling and wouldn’t relent. In turn the defense forced a turnover on the Lions first play when <strong>Matthew Stafford’s</strong> pass to <strong>Golden Tate</strong> was knocked loose by <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcolm-butler-0\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"West Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_butler_malcolm.png?itok=qp7y7-vt&timestamp=1497559945\" class=\"player\">Malcolm Butler</a></strong>. Brady then took the quick change and hit <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/chris-hogan\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Monmouth (N.J.)\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-2017-hogan-chris-headshot-revised.png?itok=vlWt8xdt&timestamp=1497563672\" class=\"player\">Chris Hogan</a></strong> for a 32-yard touchdown. The game was less than five minutes old and it was already 13-0. That was a big part of the team’s MO back in 2007 when the offense suffocated the life out of opponents on a regular basis.</p>\\n<p>-Unfortunately it was not all roses for the offense as Edelman went down with a potentially serious right knee injury. Multiple reports indicated the Patriots fear the wideout tore his ACL but that had yet to be confirmed. Edelman caught three passes on the drive before crumbling to the turf after the final one, suffering a non-contact injury that ended his night.</p>\\n<p>-Depending on Edelman’s status, if he’s out long term it would open up a roster spot but not necessarily for a wide receiver. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/devin-lucien\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Arizona State\" data-player-experience=\"1\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0011_lucien_devin.png?itok=0SxtChiw&timestamp=1497566947\" class=\"player\">Devin Lucien</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/austin-carr\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Northwestern\" data-player-experience=\"Rookie\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_carr_austin.png?itok=Mn3Z5AEy&timestamp=1497560289\" class=\"player\">Austin Carr</a></strong> would be candidates if Bill Belichick went that route but <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/dj-foster\" data-player-height=\"6-0\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Arizona State\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0013_foster_d.j.png?itok=zqMfRJYN&timestamp=1497563267\" class=\"player\">D.J. Foster</a></strong> would also factor into that mix. Foster was a wide receiver in college and has shown the ability to catch the ball effectively in the preseason. He did enough to earn a roster spot last season despite being inactive most of the year. There’s also the possibility that Belichick doesn’t use a receiver at all and instead simply looks for the next-best player on the bubble. One factor to keep in mind is the punt return game. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/danny-amendola\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Texas Tech\" data-player-experience=\"9\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/2016_amendola_headshot_0.png?itok=Lk1vOb0E&timestamp=1464729420\" class=\"player\">Danny Amendola</a></strong> could be a more important piece on offense if Edelman is out, and Belichick may not want to expose him to further punishment as the punt returner. Many people believe <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cyrus-jones\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0023_jones_cyrus.png?itok=KUx5hJfu&timestamp=1497567532\" class=\"player\">Cyrus Jones</a></strong> could be on the bubble and perhaps his presence as a returner could make him safe.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video center width-100\">\\n    \\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-video field--type-file field--label-hidden\">\\n    <div class=\"media-nflc-video media-nflc-fpp-584446\">\\n  <nflcs:avplayer id=\"avplayer-extended\"\\n        data-config=\"http://www.patriots.com/media/nflc-config.json\"\\n    data-contentId=\"fpp-584446\"\\n    data-autoplay=\"false\"\\n    data-pr=\"1\"    data-offset=\"0\"    data-companion=\"1\"\\n    data-channelkey=\"Video_Press_Conference\"\\n    data-channelid=\"2316\"\\n    data-adtagsuffix=\"\"\\n    data-playername=\"media-player-embed\"\\n    data-chromeless=\"\"\\n    data-mediatype=\"video\"\\n        data-videoID=\"11e05fe0-17a7-48eb-99f4-d977ebf582ed\"        class=\"nflcs-avplayer\"\\n    ></nflcs:avplayer>\\n</div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n    Tom Brady 8/25: \\'We\\'re all hoping for the best\\'  </div>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p>-Interestingly, Belichick had both Jones and Amendola back deep together to return the Lions first punt of the night. At times in the past he’s employed two return men but generally has one further upfield and one back deep. Against Detroit both were almost side by side instead.</p>\\n<p>-<strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong> made his preseason debut and Belichick may have offered a glimpse about his potential as a goal line back. He entered the game for the first time with the Patriots already leading 13-0 and the ball sitting at the Lions 1. He easily worked his way off right tackle behind <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/james-develin\" data-player-height=\"6-3\" data-player-weight=\"255\" data-player-position=\"FB\" data-player-college=\"Brown\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0023_develin_james.png?itok=v78L3GFE&timestamp=1497563265\" class=\"player\">James Develin</a></strong> and James O’Shaughnessy with the latter serving as the third tight end. When the Lions were flagged on the PAT, Belichick opted to accept the penalty and attempt a two-point conversion, which Gillislee and the Patriots converted by running the same exact play. Gillislee later added a 27-yard run, showing some big play ability in addition to his nose for the goal line.</p>\\n<p>-Perhaps overshadowed by the tremendous offense early on, the defense was equally dominant. On the Lions first four series the Patriots limited them to 36 yards and no first downs. Butler punched the ball away from Tate to stop the first drive and three punts soon followed. Matt Patricia used a rotation at corner as the first half progressed, starting with <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/eric-rowe\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"205\" data-player-position=\"DB\" data-player-college=\"Utah\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0040_rowe_eric.png?itok=ML3zLcVs&timestamp=1497568195\" class=\"player\">Eric Rowe</a></strong> as the third corner before having him replace first Butler and then <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/stephon-gilmore\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"South Carolina\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0008_gilmore_stephon.png?itok=9Dl9N_xl&timestamp=1497562813\" class=\"player\">Stephon Gilmore</a></strong> in the base defense. Gilmore and Rowe were solid in coverage, particularly Gilmore who also came up with an excellent tackle to prevent a first down on an early third down. Butler, however, struggled after he forced the early turnover. He allowed <strong>Marvin Jones</strong> to get past him for the Lions first touchdown, a play in which he lost his technique when he looked back for the football.</p>\\n<p>-In the second half the rotations on defense continued, only they moved up front. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/alan-branch\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"350\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"11\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_branch_alan.png?itok=V4ouikNJ&timestamp=1497560349\" class=\"player\">Alan Branch</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/vincent-valentine\" data-player-height=\"6-3\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"DT\" data-player-college=\"Nebraska\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0033_valentine_vincent.png?itok=AMj59au4&timestamp=1497568933\" class=\"player\">Vincent Valentine</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/lawrence-guy\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"305\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Arizona State\" data-player-experience=\"7\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0004_guy_lawrence.png?itok=5gQzsiWr&timestamp=1497562808\" class=\"player\">Lawrence Guy</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcom-brown\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Texas\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_brown_malcom.png?itok=W1beu2Ce&timestamp=1497560349\" class=\"player\">Malcom Brown</a></strong> all saw action with units that generally featured backups throughout the third quarter. The way Branch played he seemed like a veteran who wasn’t all that happy being on the field in such a situation. On his series he overpowered the Lions guard and nearly broke up a running play in the backfield and then followed that with a one-armed sack of Stafford. He soon took a seat on the bench for the rest of the night.</p>\\n<p>-<strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/jordan-richards\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"DB\" data-player-college=\"Stanford\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0001_richards_jordan.png?itok=VZGcTX4v&timestamp=1497567058\" class=\"player\">Jordan Richards</a></strong> opened the night as one of the players who figures to be on the bubble and Belichick and Patricia put him on the field early and often. He was utilized in different ways, operating as a pseudo-linebacker near the line of scrimmage at times. Unfortunately he continues to struggle with his tackling, particularly on <strong>Dwayne Washington’</strong>s 18-yard touchdown reception when he missed badly after a short catch. Richards’ roster spot is by no means safe at this point.</p>\\n<p>-The Patriots coughed up their 24-0 lead and trailed Detroit, 28-24, heading down the stretch. To that point Garoppolo hadn’t moved the ball at all, closing the first half and the entire third quarter without managing a single first down. But as has often been the case with him, the no-huddle attack seemed to serve him well. He led a pair of field goal drives to close the game, the second ending with a 45-yard <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/stephen-gostkowski\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"215\" data-player-position=\"K\" data-player-college=\"Memphis\" data-player-experience=\"12\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0007_gostkowski_stephen.png?itok=A4Tn6OjF&timestamp=1497562876\" class=\"player\">Stephen Gostkowski</a></strong> boot that won it.

Hopefully, that\\'s not the case, but you know, we\\'ll figure out tomorrow.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how potentially losing Edelman could affect him: </em><br />\"Yeah, we\\'ve played together for a long time.

Hopefully he can, you know, hopefully whatever tests they have to do, come back positively. We\\'ll try to do our best to kind of, you know, lift his spirits if we can and see what happens.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On the maturation of the team\\'s younger wide receivers: </em><br />\"Yeah, we have a, you know, good group of skill position including tight ends and the backs. Everybody has played different roles at different times throughout the spring and the summer. You know, we\\'re still grinding our way through camp. So this is our fourth week, probably, fifth week, we finished our fifth week. We\\'ve had quite a few practices, but we are still trying to build on what we\\'re, week to week. So, whoever is in there, we have to have confidence in what they\\'re doing. You saw we had a lot of good things from a lot of good, really good players tonight.

Ultimately, the goal of training camp is to be ready for opening week and it\\'ll be here right around the corner.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how pleased he was with the offense starting tonight\\'s game: </em><br />\"Yeah, we, 24 points in the first four drives. Then, you know, we missed the 3rd-and-15. We had a kind of few plays that really sucked and then we had the interception which had sucked too, so. If you take those away, it\\'d be a pretty good night. You know, we\\'d have six pretty good drives there, but we\\'ll learn from them. It\\'s always good to calibrate where you are at and not everything is going to be perfect all the time. You take the lessons you learn from these preseason games and you try to apply them in a couple weeks when it really matters. So, I think the thing about these preseason games is whatever the outcome, you know, none of it\\'s, you know, going to count toward the standing, but you better learn a lot. You better learn what you\\'re all about and who you can count on. You know, it\\'s a good gage at where you\\'re at against other teams.

In 2013, the Lions devoured New England 40-9, after having walloped the Patriots 34-10 two years earlier.</p>\\n<p>Of course, Bill Belichick’s squads advanced to the AFC Championship Game in both seasons, as well as Super Bowl XLVI in 2011. Detroit, meanwhile, lost its wildcard playoff game in ’11 and failed to make the postseason in ’13.</p>\\n<p>So, while third preseason contests are universally regarded as the preseason’s primary tune-ups for the upcoming regular season, they aren’t always perfect indicators of how a team will finish the year.</p>\\n<p>This Friday night in Detroit, it was New England doing almost all the damage, blanking the Lions 24-0 after one quarter of play. However, the one wound the Lions did inflict at the outset could prove to be a significant one.</p>\\n<p>On the game’s opening drive, the Patriots found themselves moving the football with ease against a relatively tame Lions defense. However, wide receiver <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/julian-edelman\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Kent State\" data-player-experience=\"9\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0019_edelman_julian.png?itok=XBS_x3I6&timestamp=1497563247\" class=\"player\">Julian Edelman</a></strong> appeared to suffer a serious injury to his right knee on the possession. The play was a 2nd-and-3 from the Detroit 32. Quarterback <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong> fired a shotgun pass over the middle to Edelman, who made the catch, turned up-field, and encountered a trio of Lions defenders. It looked as if Edelman was hurt when he planted his right leg to avoid a defender.</p>\\n<p>Edelman immediately rolled over on the turf and grabbed his right knee. He managed to lift himself up, but limped noticeably to the Patriots sideline, where he underwent an examination inside a pop-up blue tent (a new feature on NFL sidelines this season).</p>\\n<p>After Edelman was carted off to the locker room for further observation and treatment, the Patriots announced that he was questionable to return to action in the game. He was later declared out and never returned to the field.</p>\\n<p>“You never want to see a guy go down,” tight end <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/rob-gronkowski\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"TE\" data-player-college=\"Arizona\" data-player-experience=\"8\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/2016_500x500_rob_gronkowski2_headshots.png?itok=Mv8mUQY3&timestamp=1464794393\" class=\"player\">Rob Gronkowski</a></strong> lamented later. “Just hope the best for him. Didn’t really see it. I don’t know what’s going on [with him]. Hoping it’s nothing serious.”</p>\\n<p>“I didn’t even see the play,” maintained running back <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/dion-lewis\" data-player-height=\"5-8\" data-player-weight=\"195\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Pittsburgh\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0013_lewis_dion.png?itok=bOx9mQCO&timestamp=1497567313\" class=\"player\">Dion Lewis</a></strong>, “but it’s tough to see that happen to a guy like him who works so hard. I don’t know exactly what it is, but… I saw him get up hobbling. He’s a pretty tough guy, so, I knew it was something [bad]. Whatever it may be, I know he’s going to bounce back. He works hard. He’ll be okay.”</p>\\n<p>Of course, it remains to be seen just how severe this injury is.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_gallery\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_gallery\">\\n    <a id=\"embedded-gallery-584406-304446\" class=\"embedded-gallery\" href=\"http://www.patriots.com/galleries/2017/08/25/patriots-vs-lions-preseason-week-3\" title=\"Patriots vs. Lions: Preseason Week 3\">\\n    \\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-cover-photo field--type-image field--label-hidden\">\\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.patriots.com/sites/patriots.com/files/media-ap/b3a3a0e1cb904c40a24ba7f63a768e57.jpg\" width=\"2700\" height=\"1900\" />  </div>\\n    <div class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay\">\\n      <div class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay-icon\"></div>\\n      <div class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay-caption\">\\n        <div class =\"embedded-gallery-details\">\\n          <span class=\"embedded-gallery-overlay-subheading\">View gallery</span><span class=\"gallery-count\">84 Slides</span>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class =\"embedded-gallery-title\">\\n          <h3>Patriots vs. Lions: Preseason Week 3</h3>\\n        </div>\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  </a>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p>In the meantime, it’s not as if New England doesn’t have enough weaponry on offense to survive a potential Edelman loss, regardless of how long he may be out of commission. \\xa0\\xa0Certainly, Brady may miss one of his most reliable targets, and that could change some of what offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels envisioned with a fully loaded arsenal of talent at his disposal.

At this point, that’s still a possibility, provided Friday’s scare is nothing more than that. \\xa0\\xa0</p>\\n<p>In the interim, there was plenty of reason to be encouraged by the performance of the reigning Super Bowl champions.</p>\\n<p>Even after Edelman departed, the offense, under the direction of Brady, carved up the Lions, both through the air and on the ground. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/chris-hogan\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Monmouth (N.J.)\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-2017-hogan-chris-headshot-revised.png?itok=vlWt8xdt&timestamp=1497563672\" class=\"player\">Chris Hogan</a></strong> stepped up on the receiving end of things, with four magnificent grabs, two of which went for touchdowns.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong>’s debut in the Patriots backfield was a resounding success, as he scored on his very first and second touches (a touchdown and ensuing two-point conversion).

We saw it tonight, too.”</p>\\n<p>McDaniels and head coach Bill Belichick had to be pleased enough with what they saw that, by halftime, it became clear that the starters would be done for the night.</p>\\n<p>On defense in the first half, when most of the starters on both sides were on the field, \\xa0</p>\\n<p>New England’s pass rush didn’t quite exert itself on Lions QB Matthew Stafford with any consistency, but that was to be expected, given the attrition the Patriots have suffered at that spot this summer.</p>\\n<p>However, the overall play of the cornerbacks stood out. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcolm-butler-0\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"West Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_butler_malcolm.png?itok=qp7y7-vt&timestamp=1497559945\" class=\"player\">Malcolm Butler</a></strong> led them off with a forced fumble on the Lions’ first play. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/stephon-gilmore\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"South Carolina\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0008_gilmore_stephon.png?itok=9Dl9N_xl&timestamp=1497562813\" class=\"player\">Stephon Gilmore</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/eric-rowe\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"205\" data-player-position=\"DB\" data-player-college=\"Utah\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0040_rowe_eric.png?itok=ML3zLcVs&timestamp=1497568195\" class=\"player\">Eric Rowe</a></strong> knocked down and/or intercepted several other Matthew Stafford passes, and all made a number of nice open-field tackles.</p>\\n<p>Yes, Butler surrendered a deep touchdown reception just before halftime, but this secondary is showing the big-play potential that many observers felt was possible heading into 2017.</p>\\n<p>The Lions clawed back fiercely in the second half, but by then, New England was playing all backups. In this game, only the first half of action truly mattered, and what transpired came as no surprise.</p>\\n<p>“It was a good start,” Gronkowski added. “Coming out fast, scoring a touchdown on the first drive – that’s how you want to start a ballgame.”</p>\\n<p>We already expected New England’s offense to be very good, and its defense to be strongest at the back end, with question marks remaining up front. So, it wouldn’t be wise to get too excited or disappointed about anything we witnessed at Ford Field Friday night, with the exception of Edelman’s health status.</p>\\n<p>His injury was the most significant development to result from this game and, until the situation becomes clearer, is sure to dominant discussion as the Patriots return to Foxborough and enter the final week of the preseason.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n',\n",

Almost in every area you turn it over, you give it back to a pretty explosive offense, they move it down and score on you twice within a short period of time. I think in all phases, too many penalties. That first quarter, we were too sloppy. And then we finally got things on track a little bit where we finally got a couple stops defensively and started to move the ball. The way the guys fought back in the second half was good, but we got a lot of things to work on. We just were not as sharp as we\\'d like to be.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On if there was a most frustrating part about trailing 24-0:\\xa0</em><br />\"No, I mean it\\'s a collection of things. We just were ineffective for a stretch there, in all phases, really. Too many penalties on special teams. It backed us up in situations where we may have had a play or two here. Not really sharp as we\\'d like to be on defense. They moved the ball on us pretty easily. And then obviously turning the ball over on offense. Those things were not like what we want to see. We looked a little bit, in some cases particularly kicking game, we had to waste a timeout. You know, a substitution issue. So, it wasn\\'t pretty. But like I said, that part of it was tough, but the guys kind of got settled down and got their feet underneath them and we had three scores in a row in terms of drives. So, they\\'ve shown what they\\'ve always been able to do is come back and get themselves in position and at least give us a chance, which they did.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he takes away from this game about QB Jake Rudock:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, he played well. I mean he made good decisions. They moved the ball consistently with his group and I thought he managed the game well. He was patient and took advantage of opportunities where he could use his legs. He runs well, obviously. But he also delivered a lot of passes along the way. (Jared) Abbrederis made some nice catches for him. Jace Billingsley made some nice catches for him. They had a number of guys that – Tim Wright had a couple here and there. I thought overall he did a nice job. And then obviously Dwayne Washington had a big one to finish it off. He showed some power and elusiveness, so thought that was a good stretch.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he sees from RB Dwayne Washington now opposed to when he first came into the NFL:\\xa0</em><br />\"Well, yeah, I think so. I think he\\'s getting a little bit better because we\\'ve always seen that when he came out of college, we saw that he had the power and speed and the elusiveness and the ability to break tackles and those kinds of things he did from time to time. He did it a little bit more consistently today. He ran behind his pads really well. He had some good, tough yardage. And I think he just continues to get better and better and better. So, he\\'s headed in the right direction.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how Patriots QB <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong> was exploiting the team:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, one of the things, you know, he\\'s as good as they come. I mean, in particularly he\\'s got some guys he can get the ball to. He gets the ball out quickly. He makes quick decisions. You\\'re not going to show him anything he hasn\\'t seen before. I mean, he\\'s just an unusual guy. What you got to do is keep him out of the end zone, which we didn\\'t do. He\\'s going to complete some passes on you. I mean, there hadn\\'t been anybody that\\'s stopped him since he\\'s been in this league. But to be able to slow it down, keep it in front, not have a bunch of mistakes and penalties, and a couple times when they hurry up, they got a couple of advantages on us from just a leverage standpoint which shouldn\\'t happen.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he saw from LB Jarrad Davis:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, I haven\\'t looked at it in detail, but I saw a couple of them, probably the same thing you guys saw. You know, that were the isolated on the inside, and a guy beat him across his face, that kind of thing. But those are the things that you learn. That\\'s what preseason is for. It gives you a chance to look – I don\\'t think anybody\\'s ever said that he\\'s going to be absolutely perfect. You\\'re going to learn along the way. And that\\'s the thing that guys have to be able to learn to deal with is guys that have skills, speed, quickness, size, coming at you nonstop takes a little adjusting. But I think obviously, I think we have some young guys that I think learned a few lessons and we\\'ll get better for it.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On LB Tahir Whitehead\\'s injury status:\\xa0</em><br />\"I wouldn\\'t know exactly until we have an opportunity tomorrow to sit down with the doctors and kind of see where he is.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On TE Cole Wick\\'s injury status:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, same thing. He\\'s been evaluated and we\\'ll kind of see what happens.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how much of a step forward tonight was for RB Theo Riddick:\\xa0</em><br />\"It was good. It was good to get him in there and give him a chance to move around a little bit and I thought he was in position. He had a couple, he had a pretty big one coming and they get a little block at the line of scrimmage. I think (Alan) Branch got his hand up and knocked it down, but Theo I thought did well for his first day out there.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On if RB Ameer Abdullah is one of the bright spots in this preseason:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, I think he does what he does. He creates being able to get in seams, tight seams, and he creates yardage for you. He\\'ll make a guy miss here or there and I think that he\\'s been just coming along, and you can see he\\'s got his quickness and those things, his elusiveness back. So, we\\'re pleased with where he is.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On RB Zach Zenner and S Miles Killebrew not playing much tonight:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, both cases they had a bit of an injury, so we\\'ll see what happens.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On if he liked the information that he gathered about the team from playing against QB <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong>:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, I think that\\'s what preseason is for. I think even during the week when I told you guys that this team is going to challenge us in every single way, so you get a real good barometer of where you are. If you\\'re going to be a real good team in this league then there are some things that you\\'re going to have to deal with consistently and they\\'re going to show them to you, and they attack you in so many different ways that—I think we learned some things, but we know exactly what we have to work on.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On the progression of LB Jalen Reeves-Maybin:\\xa0</em><br />\"I think he\\'s naturally instinctive. So, he finds himself around the ball quite often, and I think it\\'s just a matter of him kind of get him accustomed to how we do things, and he\\'s learning that. He studies and obviously made a really good play on the screen, backed up in their own territory, so he was able to break on the ball and get a pretty good hit on the receiver. So yeah, he\\'s got some talent and got ability, we just got to keep working with him, keep him going.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how to make the opposing quarterback more uncomfortable going forward:\\xa0</em><br />\"You\\'d like to be able to obviously get your pressure with your front four. If you got to bring linebackers and perimeter guys obviously that\\'s all part of what we do as well. But we\\'d like to get a little bit more pressure on him, which we didn\\'t early on. He gets the ball out pretty quick, he\\'s not one of those guys that holds the ball, he\\'s going to get it out. He changes the tempo of the game, so you have to be rather creative in that regard.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On the ongoing process of finding a return man:\\xa0</em><br />\"Yeah, fortunately we have one more week, one more week to kind of make those decisions and we\\'ll kind of look at it and see who we need to see more of, make our evaluations form this game, and try to get in position where we can come to some final conclusions here shortly. So, next week\\'s going to be a big week for us.\"</p>\\n<h2>LIONS QB MATTHEW STAFFORD</h2>\\n<p><em>On the team\\'s tough start in today\\'s game: </em><br />\"Yeah, too many three-and-outs. \\xa0They played us in dime and quarter a lot and weren\\'t able to run the ball successfully there early, where we felt like we had some favorable looks. And then, just weren\\'t converting on third down. I got to do a better job, you know, really everybody does, of keeping those drives going.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On how he progressed through the game playing into the third quarter: </em><br />\"We finished off the first half nice, and then obviously came out and got another touchdown second half first drive, which was good. Just hate to start the way you did, but you know, it\\'s football and you just have to find a way to keep battling and we did that.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On RB Ameer Abdullah\\'s play so far this preseason: </em><br />\"Yeah, I think he\\'s done a nice job. You know, he\\'s a talented runner, obviously. Got on the edge a couple times later in the game today for us and did a nice job. Early on, tough sledding a little bit in there, but finished the game nicely.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On his chemistry with WR Marvin Jones Jr.: </em><br />\"Yeah, you know, I think there\\'s always room for improvement, from both of us, and we\\'ll continue to try and keep getting better, but you know, it\\'s nice to throw and complete some balls down the field.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what he learned about the offense from this third preseason game: </em><br />\"You know, just got to be better on third down earlier in the game. We go to stay on the field. Obviously, the turnovers hurt us, the fumble, and then obviously, the one—the ball that I threw that got tipped and ended up in their hands, so just got to do a better job of holding on to the ball and converting third downs.\"</p>\\n<p><a class=\"related-story\" href=\"http://www.patriots.com/news/2017/08/25/new-england-patriots-postgame-transcripts-825\">New England Patriots Postgame Quotes 8/25</a></p>\\n<h2>LIONS RB AMEER ABDULLAH</h2>\\n<p><em>On what he can take away from the offense\\'s performance tonight: </em><br />\"You know what, I feel like we did a good job staying composed, got the running game going a little bit and started doing what we know to do. We started converting third downs, that\\'s huge. I feel like we\\'re a really good third-down team and early on we weren\\'t that great. So, I feel like we kind of settled down. We didn\\'t let things get too big for us. We just settled down and just went back to what we knew how to do. It\\'s convert, get all the blocks, make all our right reads in our run plays and it came along.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On looking like he is getting into his groove: </em><br />\"My groove is coming along. I don\\'t think I\\'m all the way there, yet. My eyes haven\\'t been the best to my standard. It\\'s coming along and it\\'s encouraging.\"</p>\\n<p><em>On what RB Dwayne Washington showed tonight: </em><br />\"He\\'s a dog. I mean, I\\'ve said it before. I feel like he\\'s athletically a very good player. He\\'s a guy who hasn\\'t played running back that long. He went to (the University of) Washington to play receiver and then later in his career he started playing running back and he\\'s still learning. He\\'s molding into the player he\\'s becoming, the player you all saw tonight.\"</p>\\n',\n",

At some point in the near future, perhaps as soon as 2019, the Broncos\\' owner for the last 33 years should take his place with the legends of the game.</p> <p>But the wait will not end next year.</p> <p>Bowlen was not chosen as the Contributors Committee nominee for the 2018 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. The committee instead opted to nominate former Washington and San Diego general manager Bobby Beathard, whose candidacy will be considered at the meeting of the full Selection Committee next Feb. 3 in Minneapolis, one day before Super Bowl LII.</p> <p><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"aa47333e-3267-4fed-91e3-1ef4344902ec\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"0\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>The Contributors Committee bypassed Bowlen for this year despite the fact that his contributions to the league were legion, as he helped lift the entire NFL to new heights of prominence and prosperity, particularly in his roles on the NFL Finance Committee, the NFL Business Ventures Committee and his work as chairman of the NFL Broadcasting Committee.</p> <p>In that role he handled negotiations on an $18 billion contract and helped lay the groundwork for making \"Sunday Night Football\" the primary prime-time game each week; as a result, <i>SNF</i> has been the highest-rated program on television for six consecutive seasons.</p> <p>But as Bowlen said on March 23, 1984 -- the day he met the media for the first time as Broncos owner -- \"Winning is more important than making money.\"</p> <p>The first task was team success, and from a 13-3 season in his first year on the job through his 21st winning season last season, the accomplishments have accumulated quicker than the 300 wins he achieved faster than any owner in NFL history.</p> <p><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"5aaeff4d-4452-420d-b307-29ff0a55cd04\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"0\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>• Three Super Bowl wins<br />• Seven conference championships<br />• More Super Bowl appearances (seven) than losing seasons (five)<br />• Thirteen division titles<br />• Eighteen playoff appearances<br />• Most regular-season wins in the NFL<br />• Highest home attendance in the NFL since 1984</p> <p>Bowlen\\'s resume is that of a Hall of Famer, and with the Contributors Committee able to nominate two people for the 2019 Hall of Fame class, his time for induction could come soon.</p> <p>In the meantime, the Broncos will remain underrepresented in the Hall of Fame.</p> <p>Terrell Davis\\' induction earlier this month brought the total number of Hall members inducted at least in part for their contributions as Broncos to five. But that number pales in comparison with other franchises that also began play in the 1960s such as the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs (14 Hall of Famers), Minnesota Vikings (13 Hall of Famers), San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers (10 Hall of Famers) and Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans (10 Hall of Famers).</p> <p>Those clubs have as many Super Bowl appearances combined (eight) as the Broncos do on their own. They have a single world championship among themselves; the Broncos have three.</p> <p>Yet they average 11.75 Hall of Famers, a number that is almost certain to rise thanks to the Seniors Committee\\'s nomination of Oilers linebacker Robert Brazile as a finalist for the 2018 class.</p> <p>Life, and the Hall of Fame, aren\\'t fair. And now Bowlen\\'s wait, just like that of other deserving Broncos legends such as Steve Atwater, John Lynch, Randy Gradishar, Louis Wright and Karl Mecklenburg, will continue.</p>',\n",

It means responsibility, class, and professionalism. It means taking every opportunity that comes your way and running with the chance to make a difference in your community. Being a DBC means being a person of action, being beautiful inside and out and showing the kindness in your heart to not only Denver, but all of Broncos Country.</p> <p><strong>Who is your hero?</strong></p> <p>Every member of my family performs acts of heroism every day, but this year I will talk about my parents. My parents are the epitome of selfless. They have given up everything so that my sisters and I can live happy lives, full of love and comfort. They never say no when anyone asks for help and inspire me to be just as giving as they are. My parents are truly one-of-a-kind individuals that live their lives in outstanding yet humbling ways.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about the first concert you’ve ever been to?</strong></p> <p>The first concert I ever went to was Spice Girls. I was probably about 4 or 5 years old. But the first concert I remember going to was Ed Sheeran in college. He sat on the floor with us and played his guitar. It was amazing.</p> <p><strong>If there were a movie made about your life, which celebrity would you want to play you? Who would play your parents?</strong></p> <p>If my life was a movie, I think I would be played by Jordana Brewster. We look a little similar, and I think she always represents herself with class. My mother would be played by Jennifer Aniston because neither of them seem to ever age, and they are both positive, outstanding role models. My father would be played by Steve Martin because my dad is exactly like the father Steve played in Father of the Bride. I have the best parents in the world.</p> <p><strong>What is your dream vacation destination?</strong></p> <p>I would love to see New Zealand and Australia. I have never been to either and think they would provide a trip full of adventure and new experiences.</p> <p><strong>Any hidden talents or tricks you can do?</strong></p> <p>I can do some cool tricks when it comes to acrobatics, but that’s about it!</p> <p><strong>When did you first start dancing/cheerleading?</strong></p> <p>I started dancing at 2 years old, and I never stopped. My dance training continued through college where I earned my Bachelors of Fine Arts in Dance. After college, I joined the Broncos!</p> <p><strong>In 10 years I see myself…</strong></p> <p>I know I will be looking back at my time as a Denver Broncos Cheerleader and be so thankful for the friendships I made, experiences I was given, and lessons I learned.</p> <p><strong>As a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></p> <p>I wanted to be a dentist for most of my childhood. I think there was a brief period of time where I thought I wanted to be a firefighter. In reality, I think I wanted to make a successful future for myself like my parents had, and I gravitated towards a career that would find me stability, even as a kid.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give your younger self?</strong></p> <p>Don’t make excuses. You are perfect the way you are; you don’t need to make an excuses for not being exactly like everyone else.</p>',\n",

That\\'s an important factor when trying to determine who will lead the Patriots in catches because Brady needs to feel comfortable when he throws you the football. Once he does the sky\\'s the limit.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Based on the early returns that won\\'t be a problem, and once Brady sees how productive Cooks is, he will continue feeding him throughout the season.

But according to a report from ESPN, Hightower is among a group of Patriots who did not travel with the team to Detroit for Friday night’s third preseason affair.</p>\\n<p>ESPN reports that linebackers <strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4805058/david-harris-fit-in-middle-of-patriots-d-should-be-on-display-vs-lions\" target=\"_blank\">Hightower, Elandon Roberts and Shea McClellin were not part of the Patriots travel party </a></strong>to take on the Lions. As such, the report speculates that veteran newcomer <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/david-harris\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"250\" data-player-position=\"LB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"11\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-david-harris-bio-headshot.png?itok=glPaTSea&timestamp=1498172841\" class=\"player\">David Harris</a></strong> could have a big role in the middle of the defense in Detroit.</p>\\n<p>While Hightower is working back into the mix after missing all of training camp and the two previous preseason games on PUP, Roberts is dealing with a rib injury that saw him carted off the field last Saturday night in Houston. McClellin has been absent with an unknown injury since early in camp that’s now forced the veteran to miss three preseason games.</p>\\n<p>Previously, <strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/blog/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4805041/with-nate-solder-not-traveling-tom-bradys-blindside-bears-watching\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN also reported that Nate Solder</a></strong>, who returned to practice this week after an extended absence to an unknown issue, did not travel, either. As such, <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cameron-fleming\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Stanford\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0015_fleming_cameron.png?itok=uPJUryJC&timestamp=1497563348\" class=\"player\">Cameron Fleming</a></strong> is expected to once again be charged with protecting <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tom-brady\" data-player-height=\"6-4\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Michigan\" data-player-experience=\"18\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/512x512-2014_0000_brady_tom.png?itok=HjgadmlJ&timestamp=1439435017\" class=\"player\">Tom Brady</a></strong>’s blind side against the Lions.</p>\\n<p>While Hightower, Solder, Roberts and McClellin will all apparently be out of action, New England could see running back <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong> make his debut in Detroit.

Sometimes he plays just the first half. Others he plays, comes out and then returns in the third quarter. There have even been times when he\\'s played a full three quarters. Regardless, this will be the best chance to see Brady in extended action with his new-look offense. Seeing him find a rhythm is important. Of course seeing him stay upright and healthy is even more important.</p>\\n<p><strong>Tackle football </strong>- Left tackle <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/nate-solder\" data-player-height=\"6-8\" data-player-weight=\"325\" data-player-position=\"T\" data-player-college=\"Colorado\" data-player-experience=\"7\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0038_solder_nate.png?itok=oveSJ7Er&timestamp=1497567994\" class=\"player\">Nate Solder</a></strong> returned to practice this week, but reportedly did not travel to Detroit. That means <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cameron-fleming\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"320\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Stanford\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0015_fleming_cameron.png?itok=uPJUryJC&timestamp=1497563348\" class=\"player\">Cameron Fleming</a></strong> will once again likely be protecting Brady\\'s blind side. Fleming has been up and down at various times this summer. The rest of the returning offensive line starters should be on the field for extended action in front of their 40-year-old passer, but it\\'s Fleming who\\'s most in the spotlight. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/laadrian-waddle\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"315\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Texas Tech\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0030_waddle_laadrian.png?itok=aQG8bQj9&timestamp=1497567914\" class=\"player\">LaAdrian Waddle</a></strong> returned to practice after missing a week due to a reported concussion, while rookie <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/tony-garcia\" data-player-height=\"6-7\" data-player-weight=\"302\" data-player-position=\"OL\" data-player-college=\"Troy\" data-player-experience=\"Rookie\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0011_garcia_tony.png?itok=c-RkvAsg&timestamp=1497563236\" class=\"player\">Tony Garcia</a></strong> remains out of action with an unknown injury. The depth at the tackle spot remains a competitive summer battle. Still, Fleming keeping Brady clean might be goal No. 1 on the Patriots To-Do List in Detroit.</p>\\n<p><strong>No big plays </strong>- Both the first unit defenders and the backups for the Patriots defense have been allowing big plays this summer. That\\'s not what Belichick and Matt Patricia are looking for. One of the main tenets of the defensive system in New England is not allowing big plays. The time to clean up the issue is now, not when the games begin to count in a couple weeks. The Lions have the weapons to make plays, so New England will have to play better to achieve this goal. That means much better coverage and much better tackling.</p>\\n<p><strong>On edge</strong> - The competition to fill out the depth chart on the edge of the Patriots defense is ongoing. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/trey-flowers\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"DL\" data-player-college=\"Arkansas\" data-player-experience=\"3\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0014_flowers_trey.png?itok=6Py8Daj5&timestamp=1497563425\" class=\"player\">Trey Flowers</a></strong> sat out the first two games. His debut in Detroit would ease questions about his health and how ready he is to be Da Man at defensive end. Otherwise it\\'s a continued mixing and matching of bodies to see what mix works. Kony Ealy gets another chance to prove his worth. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/harvey-langi\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"252\" data-player-position=\"LB\" data-player-college=\"Brigham Young\" data-player-experience=\"Rookie\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0015_langi_harvey.png?itok=xYrJ31Fk&timestamp=1497568324\" class=\"player\">Harvey Langi</a></strong> too. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/donta-hightower\" data-player-height=\"6-3\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"LB\" data-player-college=\"Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"6\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0000_hightower_donta.png?itok=zts2lz5x&timestamp=1497562797\" class=\"player\">Dont\\'a Hightower</a></strong> could very well have a role on the edge, and his return to practice from PUP was a good sign this week even if he\\'d seem unlikely to jump right into extended game action. There\\'s a serious lack of proven talent and depth on the edge of the defense and figuring out how to overcome that will be a priority, though it\\'s a process that will likely continue well into the regular season.</p>\\n<p><strong>In the running </strong>- <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/mike-gillislee\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"219\" data-player-position=\"RB\" data-player-college=\"Florida\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0009_gillislee_mike.png?itok=fXADB8L9&timestamp=1497562749\" class=\"player\">Mike Gillislee</a></strong> returned to practice this week after missing the first two preseason games and plenty of practice action with a hamstring injury. The veteran newcomer deemed himself 100-percent healthy.

It\\'s a crowded, talented backfield and Friday night\\'s action could give another hint to how the competition at running back might be playing out.</p>\\n<p><strong>Bounce back, Butler </strong>- <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/malcolm-butler-0\" data-player-height=\"5-11\" data-player-weight=\"190\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"West Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_butler_malcolm.png?itok=qp7y7-vt&timestamp=1497559945\" class=\"player\">Malcolm Butler</a></strong> struggled in limited action in his summer debut last week in Houston. The former Pro Bowler has had an otherwise solid summer, but seeing him do it on the game field against Matthew Stafford and Co. would alieve any fears fans may have that the fourth-year player is headed toward anything other than an impressive season. The Patriots secondary is expected to be the strength of the defense. Butler and his fellow veteran brethren can measure themselves against a Detroit passing attack that ranked No. 11 in the NFL a year ago.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jimmy\\'s ball security </strong>- <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/jimmy-garoppolo\" data-player-height=\"6-2\" data-player-weight=\"225\" data-player-position=\"QB\" data-player-college=\"Eastern Illinois\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0010_garoppolo_jimmy.png?itok=wXGE4X3l&timestamp=1497563177\" class=\"player\">Jimmy Garoppolo</a></strong> wasn\\'t pleased with himself last week after an interception and lost fumble in Houston. The backup has turned the ball over a bit too often on the practice field this summer, as well. Though Friday night will be a big dose of Brady, whenever Garoppolo gets in the game the fourth-year No. 2 needs to take care of the ball. Turnovers and big mistakes are the difference between winning and losing in the NFL. At some point, somewhere, Garoppolo is going to be a starter. Ball security is a focal point any time he\\'s on the field from here on out.</p>\\n<p><strong>Competition continues</strong> - Though many believe that the bulk of the Patriots 53-man roster that will be announced on Sept. 3 is already locked up, there clearly is still some competition at various spots. That includes battles at defensive end, tight end, running back, backup tackle and in depth/special teams roles to fill out the roster. There is pressure for many guys to perform well to try to nail down at job. But as Belichick pointed out this week, life in the NFL is all about pressure.</p>\\n<p><strong>More Cyrus</strong> - Second-year former second-round pick <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/cyrus-jones\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"200\" data-player-position=\"CB\" data-player-college=\"Alabama\" data-player-experience=\"2\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_0023_jones_cyrus.png?itok=KUx5hJfu&timestamp=1497567532\" class=\"player\">Cyrus Jones</a></strong> had a terrible start to the summer in the first preseason game, allowing a 97-yard touchdown. He was much better last week, earning positive reviews from Belichick with his work in the return game. The young playmaker needs to string together positive plays and games, regardless of what role he\\'s in. Jones is one of the more notable supposed \\'bubble” guys as the preseason process winds down. After last week his arrow is pointing up. Can he keep that momentum going?</p>\\n<p><div class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video width-100\" class=\"fieldable-panels-pane embedded_video width-100\">\\n    \\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-video field--type-file field--label-hidden\">\\n    <div class=\"media-nflc-video media-nflc-fpp-583931\">\\n  <nflcs:avplayer id=\"avplayer-extended\"\\n        data-config=\"http://www.patriots.com/media/nflc-config.json\"\\n    data-contentId=\"fpp-583931\"\\n    data-autoplay=\"false\"\\n    data-pr=\"0\"    data-offset=\"0\"    data-companion=\"1\"\\n    data-channelkey=\"Video_Press_Conference\"\\n    data-channelid=\"2316\"\\n    data-adtagsuffix=\"\"\\n    data-playername=\"media-player-embed\"\\n    data-chromeless=\"\"\\n    data-mediatype=\"video\"\\n        data-videoID=\"3735b5cf-c507-4b94-969a-4402caf0bb36\"        class=\"nflcs-avplayer\"\\n    ></nflcs:avplayer>\\n</div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-embedded-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden\">\\n    Tom Brady 8/23: \\'I\\'ve been fortunate to do what I love\\'   </div>\\n</div>\\n</p>\\n<p><strong>Air it out</strong> - Brady and new speedy receiver <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/brandin-cooks\" data-player-height=\"5-10\" data-player-weight=\"189\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Oregon State\" data-player-experience=\"4\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500_2017_cooks_brandin.png?itok=V2AjP1D4&timestamp=1497559914\" class=\"player\">Brandin Cooks</a></strong> have connected with regularity for big plays on the practice field this summer. But we\\'ve yet to see that in a preseason game. <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/chris-hogan\" data-player-height=\"6-1\" data-player-weight=\"210\" data-player-position=\"WR\" data-player-college=\"Monmouth (N.J.)\" data-player-experience=\"5\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/500x500-2017-hogan-chris-headshot-revised.png?itok=vlWt8xdt&timestamp=1497563672\" class=\"player\">Chris Hogan</a></strong> has also had his share of big plays on the practice field, as has <strong><a href=\"http://www.patriots.com/team/players/roster/rob-gronkowski\" data-player-height=\"6-6\" data-player-weight=\"265\" data-player-position=\"TE\" data-player-college=\"Arizona\" data-player-experience=\"8\" data-player-image=\"/sites/patriots.com/files/styles/player_hover/public/2016_500x500_rob_gronkowski2_headshots.png?itok=Mv8mUQY3&timestamp=1464794393\" class=\"player\">Rob Gronkowski</a></strong>. There is no doubt that the Patriots passing game has huge big-play potential this fall, well beyond the catch-and-run success we saw from the running backs last week. It might be nice to see a tiny sample of Brady and Co. getting the ball down the field against the Lions on Friday night.

Joseph said that Booker \"should be on the roster\" after the cut to 53 players.</p> <p>\"His injury should not put him out past two weeks, three weeks max,\" Joseph said. \"Book, he\\'s on the roster.\"</p> <p>... The defining characteristic that will determine who gets the roster spots on the offensive line behind the starters? Versatility.</p> <p>\"That\\'s very important,” Joseph said. \"Obviously, the first five is your starters, but you want guys in the second five that can play multiple positions, like a swing tackle or a big guard who can play some tackle, so that\\'s definitely critical.

Roster construction, particularly beyond the starting lineup on offense and defense, is also a delicate balance that accounts for factors beyond the answer to the simple question of whether a player is good enough to make the team.</p> <p>\"I want the best guys for the roster,” Joseph said. \"Sometimes when you\\'re building a roster, you make decisions on how well they play for [Special Teams Coordinator] Brock [Olivo], smarts, guys staying healthy. So those things come into play when you\\'re building a roster, not just the promising, talented guy.</p> <p>\"It can be a guy that\\'s a smart guy that can help you in all phases.

Luckily, our recording device didn’t meet the same fate as many of his facemasks.</i></p> <p><b>Aric DiLalla: </b><i><b>Going into your second year, what do you think is going to change the most for you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>Andy Janovich: </strong>“[It’s the] same mentality, just go downhill, hit linebackers and win games. It’s pretty simple.”</p> <p><b>AD: </b><i><b>How does the role of the fullback change in Offensive Coordinator Mike McCoy’s offense?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “There’s a lot more formations that I’m put in, a little bit more in the pass game. But the run is fairly the same.”</p> <p><i><b><b><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"cc3f164b-7092-4cef-aa14-4d5f71905be4\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"3\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>AD: </b>What sort of change has that been for you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “A little different, because I’m not a guy that they usually ask to run a whole bunch of routes. So working on that’s a little different for me.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>What’s it been like to keep Running Backs Coach/Assistant Head Coach Eric Studesville as a holdover from the previous staff?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> \"It’s great. I know what to expect with him. He’s a great coach, I’ve heard from a lot of guys around the league that their coaches don’t do what he does, like give them cut ups for game days and just all the extra stuff that he gives us about linebackers in film study. He goes above and beyond.\"</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>What’s been the best thing he’s taught you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “He knows exactly what to look for, how to diagnose a play, what the linebacker’s running. He’s really good about that.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>During training camp, Special Teams Coordinator Brock Olivo raved about your work ethic. How’d it feel to have a coach talk about you like that?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “I thought it was pretty cool -- coming out here every day just working and knowing that it’s not going unnoticed. It makes you feel good about yourself.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>How is it different playing under Olivo than it was to play for former special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “Great. [Olivo is] a little different than Joe D. He doesn’t yell as much. He just talks to you. He’ll walk you through a play if you don’t understand it. He’s a great coach and I enjoy having him here.”</p> <p><i><b><b><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"afc91035-0594-43c9-9901-90d170fae9ea\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"3\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>AD: </b>You’ve gathered a bit of a cult following here in Denver. What’s it been like to see the fans adopt you the way they have?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “Any time you get fan support, it’s great. That’s what you’re out here for is playing for fans. They appreciate everything that you do, everything that you put in. When they appreciate that, it’s pretty awesome. It reminds me a little bit of [my alma mater] Nebraska. Nebraska loves the fullback too, so it’s awesome.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>Where does that appreciation for the fullback come from?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “I really, I don’t know what it is. But it’s got to start with a touchdown. After I scored against Wisconsin, people went nuts about that, because they never give the fullback the ball. So I think they saw that and got pretty excited, like they were back in the \\'90s.”</p> <p><i><b><b>AD: </b>Against Kansas City last year in Week 12, you suffered an ankle injury during the first series and stayed in the rest of the game. From both a mental and physical perspective, what was that game like for you?</b></i></p> <p><strong>AJ:</strong> “It’s tough to come out. I’ve never actually had torn ligaments in my ankle. I just thought I sprained my ankle. It’s hard to say, ‘Man, I should pull myself.’ But looking back at the film, I should’ve, because I wasn’t really going full speed. I couldn’t do my job as well as I could’ve. They could’ve put somebody in there to do a better job. Looking back, I probably should’ve come out.”</p>',\n",

And rather than let a well-respected leader get away, the Broncos made sure he’d have a home in Denver for a long time. Replacing Wade Phillips is no easy task, but Woods seems to be up to that challenge. In his first year as a defensive coordinator, Woods will look to sprinkle some sugar on a defense that still has great elements but needs a tweak after 2016. We caught up with Woods to hear about his vision heading into a bounce-back year for the Broncos.</em></p> <p><b>Aric DiLalla: <i>Have you learned anything about yourself during the process of getting ready to be defensive coordinator?</i></b></p> <p><strong>Joe Woods: </strong>I think just everything I absorbed just from the front to the back end [of the defense]. When you’re a secondary coach, you tend to focus on the things that you have to have your guys do to have success. But along the way, you pick up things that they do up front [at] the D-line, linebacker position. So I felt like I had a good idea of what we did scheme-wise with the front seven.</p> <p><img src=\"/assets/images/imported/DEN/photos/centerpiece/homepage/2017/170823_woods1.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\" width=\"384\" /></p> <p><b>AD: <i>What’s something you want fans to know about their new defensive coordinator?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>Just that I’m a hard worker, I’m very passionate, I’m going to put the time in, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure this defense stays at the level that they have been [at in] the last two years.</p> <p><b>AD: <i>Do you have a new appreciation for the type of player <nobr><a href=\"/team/roster/von-miller/036470c3-df00-47e4-a936-86200f2c88dc/\"  rel=\"/cda-web/person-card-module.htm?mode=data&id=036470c3-df00-47e4-a936-86200f2c88dc\" rev=\"player\" title=\"Von Miller\" class=\"player-card-tooltip\"><span>Von Miller</span><img src=\"/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif\"></a></nobr> is now that you’ve studied more of the defense as a whole?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>No, not really – the whole philosophy when you’re a secondary coach is rush and coverage work together. So if we cover, we buy time for him to get home. And sometimes he gets home and allows us to cover easily. He’s always been a great player. I’ve known that since the time I’ve been here, and it’s just great to have somebody of his caliber.</p> <p><strong>AD:</strong><i><b> I wrote down some of the places you coached before you joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. You’ve got Kent State, Grand Valley State, Eastern Michigan, Muskingum College -- a lot of smaller schools. And then you went straight to Tampa. How’d that happen?</b></i></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>My position coach in college, when I graduated, asked me if I ever wanted to coach. That was John Bowers, and I said, ‘Hey, I’ll give it a shot.’ And from that moment when I graduated, I’ve been coaching ever since. For me, when you coach and you coach at every level, you really have to be a good teacher. Because sometimes you’re getting players like a DB who may have been a wide receiver. … So I think throughout my career at different stops, I really learned from a lot of good coaches how to be a really good teacher.</p> <p><strong>AD:</strong> <i><b>Was that jump to the NFL a tough adjustment?</b></i></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>I found it easy. I know you have to be a great coach at any level. I’m not saying that [because] I coached smaller I-AA, Division II schools that I’m a better coach than somebody who coached at a major college level, but I think the different type of guys, the different places that I’ve been, I think it made my jump easy to the NFL because I was already, in my opinion, a good fundamental coach [and] a good technician, in terms of being a coach.</p> <p><img src=\"/assets/images/imported/DEN/photos/centerpiece/homepage/2017/08-August/170823_woods3.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px;\" width=\"384\" /></p> <p><b>AD: <i>Did your players at the NFL level respond the same way they did in college?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>The biggest thing a player wants to know is, can you help them make plays? Can you help them be a better football player? So first they look at you and say, ‘Can this guy really help me?’ Once you get into the season, and the things you’re teaching them, they use in a game and you see the results in terms of them making plays, that’s when the buy-in comes in.</p> <p><b>AD:<i> The promotion to defensive coordinator is obviously big for you, but what’s it been like to share that with your family?</i></b></p> <p><strong>JW: </strong>They’re excited. My wife’s been with me the whole time. She loves sports. She really loves to move around more than I do to the different places that we’ve been, and we’ve been all over. But I have a tremendous amount of support from my wife, a tremendous amount of support from my kids and it’s been a great experience for us in Denver.</p> <p><b>AD: <i>What’s it like to develop a script? I know you’ve done some work on that before under former defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, but has working on that as the coordinator been a change for you?</i></b></p> <p><b>JW:</b> No, it’s easy. We all had different responsibilities as position coaches under Wade. He had a lot of trust in us. He gave us a lot of responsibility in terms of what we wanted to run in different situations, so it’s really kind of the same approach with each guy being responsible for their area. I’ll overlook everything, make sure that we have everything from a game-plan standpoint the way we need it, but so far it’s been an easy transition.”<img src=\"/assets/images/imported/DEN/photos/centerpiece/homepage/2017/08-August/170823_woods2.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" width=\"575\" /></p>',\n",

During one team period repetition, he forced a hurried incompletion with a backside rush.</p> <p><img src=\"/assets/images/imported/DEN/photos/660-front/barrett_shaq_CP_160822.jpg\" style=\"float: right; border: 0; margin: 2px;\" alt=\"Shaq Barrett\" width=\"384\" /></p> <p>\"It\\'s his first day back, so he\\'s actually day-to-day right now, but he\\'s looking good [and] he\\'s feeling good,\" Joseph said, adding that there was \"absolutely\" hope that Barrett could play in the regular-season opener Sept. 11 against the Los Angeles Chargers.</p> <p>That is Barrett\\'s hope, as well. He doesn\\'t expect to play in the preseason, but if he\\'s ready for Week 1, the Broncos can breathe easier knowing they have a proven contributor with starting experience in their scheme playing on Miller\\'s opposite side.</p> <p>\"He can do a lot of the things that I can do out there,\" Miller said.</p> <p>... With this being a simulation of a regular-season week, the Broncos ditched the first-team-vs.-first-team repetitions that defined nearly all of their practices from OTAs through last week.</p> <p>The No. 1 offense and defense worked against scout-team units that mimicked the Packers\\' tactics, as is typical of regular-season preparation.</p> <p>... RB <nobr><a href=\"/team/roster/jamaal-charles/29310f39-a499-47e2-b286-bdb181489c32/\"  rel=\"/cda-web/person-card-module.htm?mode=data&id=29310f39-a499-47e2-b286-bdb181489c32\" rev=\"player\" title=\"Jamaal Charles\" class=\"player-card-tooltip\"><span>Jamaal Charles</span><img src=\"/assets/nflimg/icon-article-link.gif\"></a></nobr> saw extensive work Tuesday and should get on the field early Saturday night against the Packers in his Broncos preseason debut. Joseph said he expects to work Charles into the first 15 snaps of the game.</p> <p>The Broncos have monitored Charles\\' repetitions closely throughout the last few weeks as they look to see how the 10-year veteran\\'s knee responds to an increased workload. But Charles himself has tried to put the knee out of his mind.</p> <p>\"I\\'m not even worrying about it,\" he said. \"If [an injury] happens again, it happens. I\\'ve always believed that what is supposed to happen is going to happen, so if it\\'s meant to be, it\\'s meant to be. Right now I\\'m just going to go out there and play freely.\"</p> <p>...

Butt is eligible for the PUP list because he has not taken a practice snap as he continues to recover from a torn ACL he suffered in the Orange Bowl last December.</p> <p>Players that start the regular season on the PUP list are ineligible to join the 53-man roster for the first six weeks of the regular season. The Broncos would potentially have up to 14 weeks in total to decide whether to add him to the 53-man roster, depending on if and when he begins practicing this season.</p> <p><b><nflcs:avplayer data-contentid=\"23639973-ed1a-42c6-9130-a4818da9437e\" data-width=\"384\" data-alignment=\"right\" data-autoplay=\"false\" data-pr=\"0\" data-adtagsuffix=\";player=embedded\" data-playername=\"teamsite-embed\" style=\"width: 384px; height: 216px;\" class=\"right\"></nflcs:avplayer>PARTICIPATION REPORT:</b></p> <p>...
